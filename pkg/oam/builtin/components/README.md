# OAM Built-in Component Handlers

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam/builtin/components.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam/builtin/components)

Package `components` implements `oam.ComponentHandler` for the built-in component
types. Each handler parses a typed config from a component's `properties` and
produces the corresponding Kubernetes resources via kure's builders. Handlers are
registered with the transformer in `pkg/cmd/kurel` (`newBuiltinTransformer`), each
mapping a component `type` string to a handler implementing `CanHandle` +
`ToApplicationConfig`. Every built-in component handler also implements
`oam.PropertySchemaProvider` (`PropertySchema()`), declaring a constrained schema for its
user-facing properties so the downstream runtime can validate them before invocation. Nested
Kubernetes shapes are modeled field-by-field at full fidelity — closed objects, enums where the
API has them, and the same value validation real admission applies (ADR-036 L1: one PodSpec/
Container projection shared by every kind). Only genuine escape-hatch fields (`passthrough.object`,
`manifests`/`crd` inline content) and key→value maps whose keys are data (`nodeSelector`,
`resources.requests`/`limits`) stay open by design; the remaining open objects (`probes`,
`lifecycle`, `volumes`, the `volumeMounts` items inside an `initContainers`/`sidecars`
entry) are a known gap, not the target shape; the
`volumeDevices` items beside them, and a sidecar's `ports` items (go-kure/launcher#660), are
closed, and so is the four-key `affinity` shorthand: its schema declares the four keys and
no other, and since go-kure/launcher#790 its parser refuses any other key too. The
`initContainers`/`sidecars` entries themselves are closed (go-kure/launcher#321, see "Common
config"). The raw `corev1` `affinity` that `deployment` publishes is
a different schema and is not part of that gap — it is modeled field-by-field. `helmrelease`
takes the other route to the same strictness: its schema declares exactly the top-level
`HelmReleaseSpec` keys and leaves the nested Flux blocks open, and its handler decodes the
whole property map strictly into `HelmReleaseSpec`, refusing an unknown or wrongly typed key at
any depth (see its entry under "Per-type highlights"). Every property
(including nested object fields and array item
schemas at every depth) carries a `Description`, surfaced in the downstream runtime's generated Handler API
Reference.

The kind-named Flux source components (`helmrepository`, `ocirepository`, `gitrepository`,
`bucket`, `helmchart`) reach the same strictness another way: each schema declares exactly the top-level keys
of its source-controller spec type and leaves the nested Flux blocks open, and each handler
decodes the whole property map strictly into that type, refusing an unknown or wrongly typed key
at any depth (see their entry under "Per-type highlights"). `fluxcd-kustomization` does the same
with kustomize-controller's `KustomizationSpec`.

Every built-in component handler and component lowering rule implements
`oam.ContractDescriber` (go-kure/launcher#789): family is the component type, version is
`builtin.ContractVersion` (`v1alpha1`), no capability key is required and none is deprecated.
The four rules (`webservice`, `worker`, `helm`, `postgresql`) also implement
`oam.LoweringTargetDeclarer`, naming every type they lower into:

| Rule | Components | Traits | Policies |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| `webservice` | `deployment`, `service`, `serviceaccount` | `topology-spread`, `pvc` | |
| `worker` | `deployment`, `serviceaccount` | `topology-spread`, `pvc` | |
| `helm` | `helmrelease`, `helmtemplate`, `helmrepository`, `ocirepository`, `gitrepository`, `bucket` | `configmap`, `secret` | |
| `postgresql` | `cnpg-cluster`, `cnpg-objectstore`, `cnpg-pooler`, `cnpg-database` | | `dependency`, `placement` |

`Transformer.Seal`, which every transform runs first, refuses a registry that holds a rule
without all of its targets, whatever the document: `registry incomplete: lowering rule
component/webservice@v1alpha1 lowers into component type "service", which is not registered`.
**Breaking library change**: a consumer that registers one of these rules with only the
handlers its own documents reach (a `postgresql` without the pooler, say) now fails at the
first transform, and registers the rest. See Contract metadata in
[`pkg/oam`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam).

## Traits a lowering rule forwards

A rule that emits several components decides which of them carries each authored trait,
and a trait acts where it is carried: on that member's objects, or on the bundle that
member's group is applied in. The rules of this package forward by what a trait covers
(go-kure/launcher#794, item 8):

- **A trait that covers every object the component generates** (`prune-protection`,
  `force-replace`: a delivery intent on the application of the member that carries it)
  goes to every member the rule emits for that component: each member of `webservice`
  and `worker`, the Kustomization and the own source of `oci`, the Cluster and every
  other member of `postgresql`. A source `helm` generates, and a source several `oci`
  components share, belongs to the document and carries no trait.
- **A trait that configures how a bundle is delivered** (`fluxcd-patches`,
  `fluxcd-postbuild`: not built in; a consumer that delivers through Flux registers
  them) goes to one member per bundle, never to two members of one group, so its
  handler sees it once per bundle. `webservice`, `worker` and an `oci` with its own
  source emit one same-name sibling group, which is one bundle: the `deployment` member
  carries the trait for the first two, the Kustomization for the third. `helm`, and an
  `oci` on a shared source, emit one component beside the source, and that component
  carries it.
- **Any other trait** goes to the one member whose objects or contracts it acts on; each
  rule's entry under "Per-type highlights" says which.

**A rule whose members can land in different groups forwards a bundle trait only where
it can tell the groups, and refuses the document where it cannot.** Groups are computed
after lowering has settled, so a rule cannot ask which bundle a member will be applied
in. Applying a forwarded trait once per resulting bundle, whatever the grouping turns out
to be, is not offered: it would have to happen in the engine, after grouping, and the
refusal was kept instead.

`postgresql` is the one built-in case. Its Cluster carries every authored trait. Unless
the document orders its components (a `dependency` policy with a rule), the other
members stay in the Cluster's bundle, which the Cluster's copy configures. When it
does, the Pooler and the Databases are ordered after the Cluster, wait for nothing else
and are placed where it is, so they share one later group, and the first of them carries
a second copy for that group's bundle. A policy of the document that orders or places
one of those members on its own (a `dependency` rule or a `placement` whose `component`
is a generated name) could move it to a group neither copy reaches, so a document that
authors one of the two traits on the `postgresql` component and holds such a policy is
refused, with this cause:

```text
trait "fluxcd-patches" configures the bundle of every object this component generates, but placement policy "pooler-last" names "db-pooler", a component generated for it, on its own: that component could be applied in a bundle the trait does not reach; name "db" in the policy instead, or remove the trait
```

A policy that makes another component wait for a member separates nothing and is left
alone. A rule an extension registers owes the same: one copy per bundle where the
members provably share a group, a refusal naming the trait and the policy where a
document could separate them.

## How to read the wrong-type notes below

This document states wrong-type handling **per field**, and makes no blanket
guarantee across the package. Where a field says a present-but-wrong-type value
is rejected, that is a claim about the helper named beside it —
`parseStringField`, `parseBoolField`, `parseInt32Field`, `parseInt64Field`,
`parseObjectField`, `parseStringList` — each of which reports presence
separately from value and returns an error naming the field. A parser that
does not use one of those helpers may still reject a wrong type on its own —
several do, with their own error — so its behavior is left unspecified here.
Some fields may still fall through a bare type assertion and silently
discard a wrongly typed value instead of erroring. The shared
`parseAffinity`'s four sub-fields (`enablePodAntiAffinity`, `topologyKey`,
`podAntiAffinityType`, `nodeSelector`) were the documented example until
go-kure/launcher#452 moved them onto the helpers; the absence of a named
example is not a claim that none remain. Do not generalize a rejection note
from one field to its neighbours: adjudicate against the parser that actually
reads it.

## Component types

| `type` | Produces | Summary |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `alertmanager` | Alertmanager | Kind-named Prometheus operator Alertmanager: the whole `AlertmanagerSpec`, strictly decoded; no top-level field is required. The operator runs the pods: what the spec says of them (`image`, `replicas`, `resources`, storage, `containers`, `initContainers`, `volumes`, `securityContext`, `hostNetwork`) is held to the environment policy as a workload's is, and the deprecated `baseImage`, `tag` and `sha` are not in the schema, and are refused when not empty (an empty one writes nothing where the properties are not first validated against the schema, which refuses all three). The replica count and memory request the operator fills where they are unset are held, not written. An image the operator chooses, for `alertmanager` or one of its two reloaders, is refused under a policy with allowed registries. No capability is required — see below. |
| `artifactgenerator` | ArtifactGenerator | Kind-named Flux ArtifactGenerator: the whole `ArtifactGeneratorSpec`, strictly decoded; `sources`, each with its `alias`, `kind` and `name`, and `artifacts`, each with its `name` and a `copy` of `from` and `to`, are required. A source may be one of another namespace, whose content the generator copies into its artifacts, and nothing gates it. The API's expression rule is not checked. No environment policy applies — see below. |

| `cilium-clusterwidenetworkpolicy` | CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy | Kind-named Cilium cluster-wide network policy: `spec`, `specs` or both, each a Cilium rule, strictly decoded as the `cilium-networkpolicy` kind decodes them. A rule takes exactly one of `endpointSelector` and `nodeSelector`, and at least one of `ingress`, `ingressDeny`, `egress` and `egressDeny`. Cluster-scoped; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |

| `cilium-networkpolicy` | CiliumNetworkPolicy | Kind-named CiliumNetworkPolicy: its `spec` (one rule) and `specs` (a list of rules), each the whole Cilium rule, strictly decoded. At least one is required; each rule needs an `endpointSelector` and an entry in `ingress`, `ingressDeny`, `egress` or `egressDeny`, and `nodeSelector` is refused. An authored object, not the `cilium-networkpolicy` trait; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `cilium-nodeconfig` | CiliumNodeConfig | Kind-named Cilium per-node configuration: the whole `CiliumNodeConfigSpec` (`defaults`, `nodeSelector`, both required), strictly decoded. The keys and values of `defaults` are written as authored. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |

| `crd` | CustomResourceDefinition(s) | CRDs from `inline`/`url`; rejects non-CRD docs. |
| `cronjob` | CronJob | Scheduled job; cron `schedule` + history limits + CronJobSpec/JobSpec fields, plus the raw `affinity`/`tolerations`/`topologySpreadConstraints` (see below). |
| `csidriver` | CSIDriver | Kind-named CSIDriver: the whole `CSIDriverSpec`, strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped, and the object's name (the component's, or its `objectName`) is the driver's name; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `daemonset` | DaemonSet | Per-node daemon; honors `tolerations`, the raw `affinity` and `topologySpreadConstraints`, and takes `sidecars`. Emits no Service (go-kure/launcher#690). |
| `deployment` | Deployment | Kind-named Deployment: the shared container and pod surface, the rest of `DeploymentSpec`, the main container's `ports`, and the raw `corev1` `affinity`/`tolerations`/`topologySpreadConstraints`. Not a superset of `worker` — see below. |
| `endpointslice` | EndpointSlice | Kind-named EndpointSlice: the object's own fields (`addressType`, required; `endpoints`; `ports`), strictly decoded; an endpoint's `addresses` are required. It belongs to a Service through the `kubernetes.io/service-name` label, authored under `labels` as a literal that does not follow a Service's `objectName`. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |

| `fluxcd-provider` | Provider | Kind-named Flux Provider: the whole `ProviderSpec`, strictly decoded; `type` is required, and of an authored Secret reference its `name`.

No environment policy applies — see below. |
| `gateway` | Gateway | Kind-named Gateway API Gateway: the whole `GatewaySpec`, strictly decoded; `gatewayClassName` and `listeners` are required, and of a listener its `name`, `port` and `protocol`.

| `helm` | via `helmrelease` (+ a values `configmap` trait, a `secretValues` `secret` trait) + a generated `helmrepository`/`ocirepository`/`gitrepository`/`bucket`, or via `helmtemplate` | Role-named Helm component: Flux (`flux`) or client-side `template` delivery. Lowered to the kind-named terminals (`HelmRule`), sharing one generated source per content identity within a document. See below. |
| `helmchart` | HelmChart | Kind-named: the full Flux `HelmChartSpec`, a chart from an existing source. Not the composite removed under this name (go-kure/launcher#350); that is `helm`. |
| `helmrelease` | HelmRelease | Kind-named: the full Flux `HelmReleaseSpec`, against an existing source. |
| `helmrepository` | HelmRepository | Kind-named: the full Flux `HelmRepositorySpec`, and nothing else. |
| `helmtemplate` | rendered manifests | Kind-named client-side Helm render: `source.url`, `chart`, `version`, `values`, `secretValues`, `scopeOverrides`. What `helm` lowers to under `delivery: template`, authorable directly. The source host and every rendered workload are checked against the environment policy — see below. |
| `horizontalpodautoscaler` | HorizontalPodAutoscaler | Kind-named HorizontalPodAutoscaler: the whole `HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec`, strictly decoded; `scaleTargetRef` and `maxReplicas` are required. `maxReplicas` is held to the environment policy's replica maximum, no default filled; the target is the author's and is not checked — see below. |
| `httproute` | HTTPRoute | Kind-named HTTPRoute: the whole `HTTPRouteSpec` (`parentRefs`, `useDefaultGateways`, `hostnames`, `rules`), strictly decoded. An authored object, not the `httproute` trait: no parent is synthesized from a capability, no NetworkPolicy allow rule is synthesized for it and no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `imagepolicy` | ImagePolicy | Kind-named Flux ImagePolicy: the whole `ImagePolicySpec`, strictly decoded; `imageRepositoryRef` with its `name` and `policy` are required, and of a `semver` policy its `range`. The policy may name the ImageRepository of another namespace, and nothing gates it. The API's expression rules are not checked. No environment policy applies — see below. |
| `imagerepository` | ImageRepository | Kind-named Flux ImageRepository: the whole `ImageRepositorySpec`, strictly decoded; `image` and `interval` are required, and of an authored Secret reference its `name`. The registry of `image` is held to the environment policy's allowed registries; the tag rule is not applied, and nothing gates `accessFrom`, `serviceAccountName` or `insecure` — see below. |
| `imageupdateautomation` | ImageUpdateAutomation | Kind-named Flux ImageUpdateAutomation: the whole `ImageUpdateAutomationSpec`, strictly decoded; `sourceRef` with its `kind` and `name` and `interval` are required, and of an authored `git` its `commit` with the author's `email`. The automation commits and pushes to the repository of the GitRepository it names, which may be one of another namespace, and nothing gates it. No environment policy applies — see below. |
| `ingress` | Ingress | Kind-named Ingress: the whole `IngressSpec` (`ingressClassName`, `defaultBackend`, `tls`, `rules`), strictly decoded. An authored object, not the `ingress` trait: no NetworkPolicy allow rule is synthesized for it and no environment policy applies — see below. |

The cpu and memory of an ACME HTTP01 solver's pod template are held to the environment policy's maxima. No capability is required — see below. |
| `job` | Job | Run-to-completion workload; the same JobSpec fields as `cronjob`'s job template, plus its own `suspend` and the raw `affinity`/`tolerations`/`topologySpreadConstraints` (see below). |
| `limitrange` | LimitRange | Kind-named LimitRange: the whole `LimitRangeSpec` (`limits`, required), strictly decoded — see below. |
| `listenerset` | ListenerSet | Kind-named Gateway API ListenerSet: the whole `ListenerSetSpec`, strictly decoded; `parentRef` with its `name` and at least one of `listeners`, each with its `name`, `port` and `protocol`, are required. No capability is required and no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `manifests` | any | Raw manifests from `inline`/`url` with namespace stamping + `scopeOverrides`. Every object is checked against the environment policy — see below. |
| `metallb-bfdprofile` | BFDProfile | Kind-named MetalLB BFD profile: the whole `BFDProfileSpec` (`receiveInterval`, `transmitInterval`, `echoInterval`, `detectMultiplier`, `echoMode`, `passiveMode` and `minimumTtl`, none required), strictly decoded. It is the timers of the BFD session of the BGP peers that name it, and so how fast the loss of such a peer is noticed. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `metallb-bgpadvertisement` | BGPAdvertisement | Kind-named MetalLB advertisement over BGP: the whole `BGPAdvertisementSpec` (`ipAddressPools`, `ipAddressPoolSelectors`, `peers`, `nodeSelectors`, `serviceSelectors`, `aggregationLength`, `aggregationLengthV6`, `localPref` and `communities`, none required), strictly decoded. It says which pools' addresses MetalLB announces to which BGP peers, for which Services, and with which route attributes; one that authors nothing limits none of them. `serviceSelectors` is refused beside an aggregation length other than 32 (IPv4) or 128 (IPv6), the CRD's expression rule. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `metallb-bgppeer` | BGPPeer | Kind-named MetalLB BGP peer, at `metallb.io/v1beta2`: the whole `BGPPeerSpec` (`myASN`, required; the peer's AS number, its address or interface, its port and timers, `nodeSelectors`, `password`, `passwordSecret`, `bfdProfile` and the switches of the session), strictly decoded. It is a router the cluster's nodes hold a BGP session with, and so one MetalLB announces addresses to. A `connectTime` outside 1 to 65535 seconds, or not a whole number of seconds read in whole milliseconds, is refused, the CRD's two expression rules on a create, and so is a `peerPort: 0`. A `password` written into the object is refused under an environment policy that forbids explicit secrets. Namespaced; no capability is required — see below. |
| `metallb-community` | Community | Kind-named MetalLB Community: the whole `CommunitySpec` (`communities`, a list of aliases of a `name` and a `value`, none required), strictly decoded. It gives names to BGP community values; a BGP advertisement that names one attaches its value to what it announces. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `metallb-ipaddresspool` | IPAddressPool | Kind-named MetalLB address pool: the whole `IPAddressPoolSpec` (`addresses`, required, `autoAssign`, `avoidBuggyIPs` and `serviceAllocation`), strictly decoded. It says which Services, in which namespaces, MetalLB gives an address of which range. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `metallb-l2advertisement` | L2Advertisement | Kind-named MetalLB advertisement on the local network: the whole `L2AdvertisementSpec` (`ipAddressPools`, `ipAddressPoolSelectors`, `nodeSelectors`, `interfaces` and `serviceSelectors`, none required), strictly decoded. It says which pools' addresses MetalLB announces on the local network, from which nodes and interfaces, for which Services; one that authors nothing limits none of them. Namespaced; no environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `namespace` | Namespace | Kind-named Namespace: the whole `NamespaceSpec` (`finalizers`), strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped, named after the component; its labels are the `labels` property — see below. |
| `networkpolicy` | NetworkPolicy | Kind-named NetworkPolicy: the whole `NetworkPolicySpec` (`podSelector`, `ingress`, `egress`, `policyTypes`), strictly decoded. An authored object, not the `networkpolicy` trait: nothing scopes it to a component's pods, so an unwritten `podSelector` selects every pod of the namespace; no `policyTypes` are derived; a defective match expression of a selector is refused; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `oci` | OCIRepository, Kustomization | Sync manifests from an OCI artifact (Flux). |
| `ocirepository` | OCIRepository | Kind-named: the full Flux `OCIRepositorySpec`, with no Kustomization (compare `oci`). |
| `passthrough` | any (verbatim) | Emit **one** arbitrary object as-declared; a built-in kind has the scope the Kubernetes API gives it, any other kind the scope an authored `clusterScoped` states, or else the one registered for it (namespaced when unknown); a list is rejected, a workload, claim or autoscaler is held to the environment policy, and a Secret is refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets. |
| `persistentvolume` | PersistentVolume | Kind-named PersistentVolume: the whole `PersistentVolumeSpec`, its volume sources included, strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped. A `hostPath` or `local` source and `capacity.storage` are held to environment policy — see below. |
| `persistentvolumeclaim` | PersistentVolumeClaim | Kind-named claim: `size`, `storageClassName`, `accessModes`, `volumeMode`, `selector`, `dataSourceRef`, `volumeName`, `volumeAttributesClassName`. A workload mounts it with a `pvc` volume's `claimName` — see below. |
| `pod` | Pod | Kind-named bare Pod: the whole `PodSpec` less `ephemeralContainers`, `priority` and `overhead`, strictly decoded. Held to environment policy as a rendered Pod is; no default filled. Carries the `app` label, so traits and Services select it — see below. |
| `poddisruptionbudget` | PodDisruptionBudget | Kind-named PodDisruptionBudget: the whole `PodDisruptionBudgetSpec` (`minAvailable`, `maxUnavailable`, `selector`, `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy`), strictly decoded; no top-level field is required and the `selector` is the author's, a defective match expression of it refused. No environment policy applies — see below. |
| `podmonitor` | PodMonitor | Kind-named Prometheus operator PodMonitor: the whole `PodMonitorSpec`, strictly decoded; `selector` is required. The selector is the author's. No environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `podtemplate` | PodTemplate | Kind-named PodTemplate: its one field, `template`, strictly decoded into `PodTemplateSpec`. The pod spec is held to what the `pod` kind holds its own to and to environment policy; `activeDeadlineSeconds` is allowed, no default filled. Stored, not run: no `app` label and not a trait target — see below. |
| `postgresql` | CNPG Cluster, Pooler, ObjectStore, Database | CloudNativePG database (backup/monitoring/pooling). |
| `priorityclass` | PriorityClass | Kind-named PriorityClass: `value` (`0` when unauthored), `globalDefault`, `description`, `preemptionPolicy`, strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `prometheus-probe` | Probe | Kind-named Prometheus operator Probe: the whole `ProbeSpec`, strictly decoded; `prober.url` is required. The prober and the targets are the author's. No environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `prometheusrule` | PrometheusRule | Kind-named Prometheus operator PrometheusRule: the whole `PrometheusRuleSpec` (`groups`), strictly decoded; a group's `name` and a rule's `expr` are required. No environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `referencegrant` | ReferenceGrant | Kind-named Gateway API ReferenceGrant: the whole `ReferenceGrantSpec`, strictly decoded; `from` and `to` are required, with the group, kind and namespace of a source and the group and kind of a target. No capability is required and no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `replicaset` | ReplicaSet | Kind-named bare ReplicaSet: the whole `ReplicaSetSpec`, strictly decoded; `selector` and `template` are required. The pod template is held to what the `pod` kind holds its spec to, less `activeDeadlineSeconds`, and gains the `app` label; `replicas` and the template are held to environment policy, no default filled — see below. |
| `replicationcontroller` | ReplicationController | Kind-named bare ReplicationController: the whole `ReplicationControllerSpec`, strictly decoded; `template` is required, `selector` (a plain label map) optional. The pod template and `replicas` are held as the `replicaset` kind's are, `activeDeadlineSeconds` refused included, and the template gains the `app` label — see below. |
| `replicationdestination` | ReplicationDestination | Kind-named VolSync ReplicationDestination: the whole `ReplicationDestinationSpec` (`trigger`, the movers `rsync`, `rsyncTLS`, `rclone` and `restic`, `external`, `paused`), strictly decoded, with the policy checks of `replicationsource`. No top-level field is required and no capability is required — see below. |
| `replicationsource` | ReplicationSource | Kind-named VolSync ReplicationSource: the whole `ReplicationSourceSpec` (`sourcePVC`, `trigger`, the movers `rsync`, `rsyncTLS`, `rclone`, `restic` and `syncthing`, `external`, `paused`), strictly decoded; no top-level field is required. An authored capacity is held to the environment policy's storage maximum, a mover's cpu and memory to its maxima, and a mover's `hostProcess` switch is refused unless privileged workloads are allowed. An `rsync` mover is held to the policy's container capabilities for the seven the linked operator version adds to its container. No capability is required. Its object is of the kind the `volsync` trait builds — see below. |
| `resourcequota` | ResourceQuota | Kind-named ResourceQuota: the whole `ResourceQuotaSpec` (`hard`, `scopes`, `scopeSelector`), strictly decoded — see below. |
| `resourcesetinputprovider` | ResourceSetInputProvider | Kind-named Flux Operator ResourceSetInputProvider: the whole `ResourceSetInputProviderSpec`, strictly decoded; `type` is required, of an authored Secret reference its `name` and of a schedule its `cron`. A user or a password in `url` is refused under every policy and under none, and the host of `url` is held to the environment policy's allowed registries, whatever the type. An `ExternalArtifact` provider's selectors may list the ExternalArtifacts of another namespace or of every namespace, and nothing gates them or `serviceAccountName`. The API's expression rules are not checked — see below. |
| `role` | Role | Kind-named RBAC Role: the object's own field (`rules`), strictly decoded; a rule's `verbs`, `apiGroups` and `resources` are required, and `nonResourceURLs` are refused. Namespaced. **Ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check restricts what a role grants** — see below. |
| `rolebinding` | RoleBinding | Kind-named RBAC RoleBinding: the object's own fields (`subjects`; `roleRef`, required with its `kind` and `name`), strictly decoded; a subject's `kind` and `name` are required. The names of the role and of the subjects are the author's literals. Namespaced. **Ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check restricts what a role grants** — see below. |
| `runtimeclass` | RuntimeClass | Kind-named RuntimeClass: `handler` (required), `overhead`, `scheduling`, strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `secret` | Secret | Kind-named Secret: `stringData`, `data`, `type`, `immutable`. Every entry is emitted under `data`, base64-encoded and not encrypted. Refused under an environment policy that forbids explicit secrets. A workload reads it through a `secret` volume, `envFrom` or a `secretKeyRef` — see below. |
| `secretstore` | SecretStore | Kind-named External Secrets Operator SecretStore: the whole `SecretStoreSpec` (`provider`, `controller`, `retrySettings`, `refreshInterval`, `conditions`), strictly decoded; `provider` with exactly one provider is required, and of that provider what the API requires. A credential written into the object is refused under an environment policy that forbids explicit secrets. No capability is required — see below. |
| `service` | Service | Kind-named Service in front of pods another component owns: `selector`, the full `ports` list (with `nodePort` and `appProtocol`), all four `type` values, `clusterIP: None` for a headless one, `externalName`, the traffic policies, session affinity, the IP families and the load-balancer fields. Emits nothing else — see below. |
| `serviceaccount` | ServiceAccount | Kind-named ServiceAccount: `automountServiceAccountToken`, `imagePullSecrets`. A workload names it with `serviceAccountName` — see below. |
| `servicecidr` | ServiceCIDR | Kind-named ServiceCIDR: the whole `ServiceCIDRSpec` (`cidrs`, required, at least one), strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `servicemonitor` | ServiceMonitor | Kind-named Prometheus operator ServiceMonitor: the whole `ServiceMonitorSpec`, strictly decoded; `endpoints` and `selector` are required. The selector is the author's. No environment policy applies and no capability is required — see below. |
| `statefulset` | StatefulSet | Stateful workload with `volumeClaimTemplates`; `serviceName` names a governing `service` authored beside it. Emits no Service (go-kure/launcher#690). |
| `storageclass` | StorageClass | Kind-named StorageClass: the object's fields beside its identity (`provisioner`, required, `parameters`, `reclaimPolicy`, …), strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `tcproute` | TCPRoute | Kind-named Gateway API TCPRoute: the whole `TCPRouteSpec`, strictly decoded; `rules` and a rule's `backendRefs` are required, with the `name` of a backend and the `port` of one that is a Service. An authored object, as the `httproute` kind is: no parent is synthesized from a capability, no NetworkPolicy allow rule is synthesized for it, no capability is required and no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `tlsroute` | TLSRoute | Kind-named Gateway API TLSRoute: the whole `TLSRouteSpec`, strictly decoded; `hostnames` is required, and the rest as on a `tcproute`. An authored object on the same terms — see below. |
| `udproute` | UDPRoute | Kind-named Gateway API UDPRoute: the whole `UDPRouteSpec`, strictly decoded; required as on a `tcproute`, and an authored object on the same terms — see below. |
| `volumeattributesclass` | VolumeAttributesClass | Kind-named VolumeAttributesClass: `driverName` and `parameters` (both required, `parameters` with at least one entry), strictly decoded. Cluster-scoped; no environment policy applies — see below. |
| `webservice` | Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount (+PVC) | HTTP service with replicas, probes, env, volumes. Lowered to a same-name `deployment`, `service` and (unless `serviceAccountName` is authored) `serviceaccount` group plus a `topology-spread` trait (`WebserviceRule`) — see below. |
| `worker` | Deployment, ServiceAccount (+PVC) | Background workload (no Service/port). Lowered to a same-name `deployment` and (unless `serviceAccountName` is authored) `serviceaccount` group plus a `topology-spread` trait (`WorkerRule`) — see below. |

Only the two role kinds, `webservice` and `worker`, emit a per-component
ServiceAccount, and only when the component does not author
`serviceAccountName`. The five pod kinds (`deployment`, `statefulset`,
`daemonset`, `job`, `cronjob`) emit no ServiceAccount and no claim of their own
(go-kure/launcher#702). See "Pod-level properties" and "Referencing an existing
claim" below.

## Kind inventory

Every object the base library can construct, and how a document reaches it
(go-kure/launcher#790). A row is one of the base library's generated constructors
(`pkg/kubernetes/**/zz_generated_create.go` in `github.com/go-kure/kure`), written
`<package directory>.Create<Kind>`. Two tests hold the table to the code:

- `TestKindInventory_CoversEveryConstructor` reads those files from the linked module and
  fails when a constructor has no row, a row has no constructor, or a row's Kind cell is not
  the API version, kind and scope the constructor's doc comment gives. A base-library bump
  that adds a kind, or moves one to another API version, therefore fails until the table
  says so.
- `TestKindInventory_MatchesCallSites` holds the Status and Type columns to this package and
  `../traits`: a `kind` row's constructor is called here, a `trait` row's there or here (a
  trait may build through this package, as `configmap` does), and a `missing`, `held` or
  `not authorable` row's by neither. A `kind` or `component` row's Type is a type a handler
  or lowering rule of this package declares contract metadata for, a `trait` row's one of
  `../traits`, so a row stops passing when its handler is removed.

Not held by a test: which handler makes the call, so a `kind` row passes while its Type has a
handler and any component of this package calls its constructor; whether a `component` row's
constructor is called; the step from `trait` to `kind`, which the change that adds the kind
component makes in the row; the Decode and Notes columns, checked for presence only; and code
outside the two packages, which is not read.

Status is one of:

- `kind`: a kind component projects the object; Type is its component `type`.
- `component`: a component that is not a kind component emits it; Notes says why there is no
  kind component.
- `trait`: a trait emits it and no component does; Type is the trait `type`.
- `missing`: authorable, with no component yet. go-kure/launcher#790 adds these group by group.
- `held`: authorable, with no component until something named is in place; Notes gives the
  reason. A component for it would not do what the kind is authored for, or would act
  where no check of the build reaches.
- `not authorable`: no component is planned; Notes gives the reason.

**Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration** (go-kure/launcher#790). Seven kinds
have no kind component: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, MutatingWebhookConfiguration,
ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and its binding, MutatingAdmissionPolicy and its binding
(`admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`), and APIService (`apiregistration.k8s.io/v1`). One rule
holds the group, and it rests on what the Kubernetes documentation says these objects do,
not on anything this package reads:

- **They act on every other document's objects, or on the API itself.** The API server
  applies an admission object to the requests its rules match, in any namespace and from
  any author; an APIService hands a group and version of the API to the Service it names.
- **The mutating ones undo what the environment policy checked at build.** A
  MutatingWebhookConfiguration or a MutatingAdmissionPolicy changes an object after it left
  the build, so what the policy held at build need not hold of the object that is stored.
- **The environment policy has no dimension for cluster-wide admission.** Nothing in it
  could bound what such a component matches.
- **A ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and its binding** change nothing and send nothing anywhere,
  but they can deny writes for the whole cluster, and no consumer has asked for them. They
  are taken up when one does.

An RBAC grant, which launcher does emit, is different: it names its subjects, and the
document that makes the grant states it. These seven act on objects no document of the build
names. The rows hold the kind components only; what `manifests`, `passthrough` and template
delivery do with such a document is said in their own entries.

Decode is how the properties become the object: `hand-written parser` (a schema and parser this
package or `../traits` maintains) or a strict decode into the named upstream type, where an
unknown or wrongly typed key is an error at every depth the decoder reaches. It does not reach
inside an upstream type that unmarshals itself, where an unknown nested key is dropped unless
the row says the type is checked separately, as the CiliumNetworkPolicy row does.

| Constructor | Kind | Status | Type | Decode | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `kubernetes.CreateAPIService` | apiregistration.k8s.io/v1 APIService (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | It hands a group and version of the API to the Service it names. See "Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration" above. |
| `kubernetes.CreateBackendTLSPolicy` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 BackendTLSPolicy | kind | `backendtlspolicy` | strict decode of `BackendTLSPolicySpec` | `targetRefs`, at least one, and `validation` with its `hostname` must be written; of a target, a CA certificate reference and a subject alternative name that are authored, the fields the API requires that the type would write empty. The hostnames it validates are not held to the allowed registries. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateBinding` | v1 Binding | not authorable | - | - | A request body for a pod's `binding` subresource, not a stored object. |
| `kubernetes.CreateCSIDriver` | storage.k8s.io/v1 CSIDriver (cluster-scoped) | kind | `csidriver` | strict decode of `CSIDriverSpec` | The object's name, the component's or its `objectName`, is the CSI driver's name. The API documents a limit of 63 characters for it and the API server does not hold the object to that limit. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateCSINode` | storage.k8s.io/v1 CSINode (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Written by the kubelet for the CSI drivers on its node. |
| `kubernetes.CreateCSIStorageCapacity` | storage.k8s.io/v1 CSIStorageCapacity | not authorable | - | - | Written by a CSI driver's provisioner. |
| `kubernetes.CreateClusterRole` | rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 ClusterRole (cluster-scoped) | kind | `clusterrole` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | **Ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check restricts what a role grants.** A rule's `verbs` must be written, and either its `apiGroups` and `resources` or its `nonResourceURLs`; an `aggregationRule` needs a selector. The `rbac` trait emits one too, through its own hand-written parser. |
| `kubernetes.CreateClusterRoleBinding` | rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 ClusterRoleBinding (cluster-scoped) | kind | `clusterrolebinding` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | **Ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check restricts what a role grants.** `roleRef` with its `kind` and `name` must be written, a subject's `kind` and `name`, and a ServiceAccount subject's `namespace`. The names are the author's literals. The `rbac` trait emits one too, through its own hand-written parser. |
| `kubernetes.CreateComponentStatus` | v1 ComponentStatus (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Read-only: the API server computes it. |
| `kubernetes.CreateConfigMap` | v1 ConfigMap | kind | `configmap` | hand-written parser | The `configmap` trait builds through the same path. |
| `kubernetes.CreateControllerRevision` | apps/v1 ControllerRevision | not authorable | - | - | Written by the StatefulSet and DaemonSet controllers. |
| `kubernetes.CreateCronJob` | batch/v1 CronJob | kind | `cronjob` | hand-written parser | - |
| `kubernetes.CreateCustomResourceDefinition` | apiextensions.k8s.io/v1 CustomResourceDefinition (cluster-scoped) | component | `crd` | the manifest parser, CustomResourceDefinition documents only | The stated exception: an application takes its CRDs from upstream files (`inline` or `url`), so no kind component projects the spec. |
| `kubernetes.CreateDaemonSet` | apps/v1 DaemonSet | kind | `daemonset` | hand-written parser | - |
| `kubernetes.CreateDeployment` | apps/v1 Deployment | kind | `deployment` | hand-written parser | `webservice` and `worker` lower onto it. |
| `kubernetes.CreateEndpointSlice` | discovery.k8s.io/v1 EndpointSlice | kind | `endpointslice` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | A slice belongs to a Service only through its `kubernetes.io/service-name` label, authored under `labels` as a literal that does not follow the Service's `objectName`. `addressType` and an endpoint's `addresses` must be written. The addresses and FQDNs of its endpoints are not artifact sources. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateEndpoints` | v1 Endpoints | not authorable | - | - | Not offered: deprecated upstream in favour of EndpointSlice. |
| `kubernetes.CreateEvent` | v1 Event | not authorable | - | - | A record the system writes at run time. |
| `kubernetes.CreateEviction` | policy/v1 Eviction | not authorable | - | - | A request body for a pod's `eviction` subresource, not a stored object. |
| `kubernetes.CreateGRPCRoute` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 GRPCRoute | kind | `grpcroute` | strict decode of `GRPCRouteSpec` | On the `httproute` kind's recipe: nothing required or filled, no environment policy, parent and backend references carried as authored, their namespaces included. The API requires no rule, backend or hostname of a GRPCRoute, as of an HTTPRoute, unlike the TCP, UDP and TLS routes. No type under `GRPCRouteSpec` unmarshals itself, so the decode reaches every depth. |
| `kubernetes.CreateGateway` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 Gateway | kind | `gateway` | strict decode of `GatewaySpec` | `gatewayClassName` and `listeners` must be written, and of a listener its `name`, `port` and `protocol`; of what is authored below them, the fields the API requires that the type would write empty. `defaultScope` is an experimental-channel field. The pods a controller starts for a Gateway are not the object's to size. No capability is required: the Gateway an `httproute` trait takes from a capability is not this component. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateGatewayClass` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 GatewayClass (cluster-scoped) | kind | `gatewayclass` | strict decode of `GatewayClassSpec` | `controllerName` must be written, and of a `parametersRef` that is authored its `group`, `kind` and `name`. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateHTTPRoute` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 HTTPRoute | kind | `httproute` | strict decode of `HTTPRouteSpec` | No type under `HTTPRouteSpec` unmarshals itself, so the decode reaches every depth. The `httproute` trait, which `expose` lowers onto, builds its own HTTPRoute with a hand-written parser. Only the trait feeds the NetworkPolicy synthesis, takes its parent from a capability and is held to the policy's capability lists. |
| `kubernetes.CreateHorizontalPodAutoscaler` | autoscaling/v2 HorizontalPodAutoscaler | kind | `horizontalpodautoscaler` | strict decode of `HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec` | `scaleTargetRef` and `maxReplicas` must be written. `maxReplicas` is held to the environment policy's replica maximum. The `scaler` trait emits one for its workload too, through its own parser. |
| `kubernetes.CreateIPAddress` | networking.k8s.io/v1 IPAddress (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Allocated by the API server for a Service. |
| `kubernetes.CreateIngress` | networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress | kind | `ingress` | strict decode of `IngressSpec` | The `ingress` trait, which `expose` lowers onto, builds its own Ingress with a hand-written parser. Only the trait feeds the NetworkPolicy synthesis and is held to the platform's hostname constraint and the policy's capability lists. |
| `kubernetes.CreateIngressClass` | networking.k8s.io/v1 IngressClass (cluster-scoped) | kind | `ingressclass` | strict decode of `IngressClassSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties, the default-class annotation (`ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`) included. `controller` must be written. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateJob` | batch/v1 Job | kind | `job` | hand-written parser | - |
| `kubernetes.CreateLease` | coordination.k8s.io/v1 Lease | not authorable | - | - | Written at run time by its holder: a leader-election client, or the kubelet for its node's heartbeat. |
| `kubernetes.CreateLimitRange` | v1 LimitRange | kind | `limitrange` | strict decode of `LimitRangeSpec` | - |
| `kubernetes.CreateListenerSet` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 ListenerSet | kind | `listenerset` | strict decode of `ListenerSetSpec` | `parentRef` with its `name` and `listeners`, at least one, must be written, and of each listener its `name`, `port` and `protocol`, as on a Gateway's. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateMutatingAdmissionPolicy` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 MutatingAdmissionPolicy (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | It changes objects of any namespace after the build. See "Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration" above. |
| `kubernetes.CreateMutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 MutatingAdmissionPolicyBinding (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | It puts a MutatingAdmissionPolicy into effect. See "Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration" above. |
| `kubernetes.CreateMutatingWebhookConfiguration` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 MutatingWebhookConfiguration (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | It changes objects of any namespace after the build. See "Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration" above. |
| `kubernetes.CreateNamespace` | v1 Namespace (cluster-scoped) | kind | `namespace` | strict decode of `NamespaceSpec` | The component name is the Namespace's name. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. |
| `kubernetes.CreateNetworkPolicy` | networking.k8s.io/v1 NetworkPolicy | kind | `networkpolicy` | strict decode of `NetworkPolicySpec` | No type under `NetworkPolicySpec` unmarshals itself except `intstr.IntOrString` (a port), a scalar with no nested key to drop. The `networkpolicy` trait builds its own NetworkPolicy with a hand-written parser and scopes it to its component's pods; the kind selects what the author wrote. The transform's NetworkPolicy synthesis in `pkg/oam` emits NetworkPolicies of its own and reads neither. |
| `kubernetes.CreateNode` | v1 Node (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Registered by the kubelet. |
| `kubernetes.CreatePersistentVolume` | v1 PersistentVolume (cluster-scoped) | kind | `persistentvolume` | strict decode of `PersistentVolumeSpec` | Held to environment policy on every path that produces one. |
| `kubernetes.CreatePersistentVolumeClaim` | v1 PersistentVolumeClaim | kind | `persistentvolumeclaim` | hand-written parser | The `pvc` trait builds through the same path. |
| `kubernetes.CreatePod` | v1 Pod | kind | `pod` | strict decode of `PodSpec` | Held to environment policy by the check the rendered paths run on a Pod; `ephemeralContainers`, `priority` and `overhead` refused. |
| `kubernetes.CreatePodDisruptionBudget` | policy/v1 PodDisruptionBudget | kind | `poddisruptionbudget` | strict decode of `PodDisruptionBudgetSpec` | No top-level field is required; a defective match expression of `selector` is refused. No environment policy applies. The `scaler` trait emits one for its workload too (`enablePDB`), through its own parser. |
| `kubernetes.CreatePodTemplate` | v1 PodTemplate | kind | `podtemplate` | strict decode of the object's `template` (`PodTemplateSpec`) | Held to environment policy by the check the rendered paths run on a PodTemplate; the pod spec is held to the `pod` kind's refusals, and `activeDeadlineSeconds` is allowed. Stored, not run: no `app` label, not a trait target. |
| `kubernetes.CreatePriorityClass` | scheduling.k8s.io/v1 PriorityClass (cluster-scoped) | kind | `priorityclass` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. An unauthored `value` is emitted as `0`. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateRangeAllocation` | v1 RangeAllocation (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | The API server's own allocation record. |
| `kubernetes.CreateReferenceGrant` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 ReferenceGrant | kind | `referencegrant` | strict decode of `ReferenceGrantSpec` | `from` and `to` must be written, and of a source its `group`, `kind` and `namespace`, of a target its `group` and `kind`. The grant is emitted in the build namespace, which is the namespace it allows references into. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateReplicaSet` | apps/v1 ReplicaSet | kind | `replicaset` | strict decode of `ReplicaSetSpec` | Held to environment policy by the check the rendered paths run on a ReplicaSet; the pod template is held to the `pod` kind's refusals, `activeDeadlineSeconds` is refused, and the template gains the `app` label. |
| `kubernetes.CreateReplicationController` | v1 ReplicationController | kind | `replicationcontroller` | strict decode of `ReplicationControllerSpec` | Held to environment policy by the check the rendered paths run on a ReplicationController; the pod template is held as the `replicaset` kind's is, `activeDeadlineSeconds` is refused, and the template gains the `app` label. `selector` is optional. |
| `kubernetes.CreateResourceQuota` | v1 ResourceQuota | kind | `resourcequota` | strict decode of `ResourceQuotaSpec` | - |
| `kubernetes.CreateRole` | rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 Role | kind | `role` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | **Ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check restricts what a role grants.** A rule's `verbs`, `apiGroups` and `resources` must be written; `nonResourceURLs` are refused. The `rbac` trait emits one too, through its own hand-written parser. |
| `kubernetes.CreateRoleBinding` | rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 RoleBinding | kind | `rolebinding` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | **Ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check restricts what a role grants.** `roleRef` with its `kind` and `name` must be written, and a subject's `kind` and `name`. The names are the author's literals. The `rbac` trait emits one too, through its own hand-written parser. |
| `kubernetes.CreateRuntimeClass` | node.k8s.io/v1 RuntimeClass (cluster-scoped) | kind | `runtimeclass` | strict decode of the object, less `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateSecret` | v1 Secret | kind | `secret` | hand-written parser | The `secret` trait builds through the same path. The `helm` component's `secretValues` synthesizes the trait. Refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets, on either path. |
| `kubernetes.CreateService` | v1 Service | kind | `service` | hand-written parser | - |
| `kubernetes.CreateServiceAccount` | v1 ServiceAccount | kind | `serviceaccount` | hand-written parser | - |

| `kubernetes.CreateTCPRoute` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 TCPRoute | kind | `tcproute` | strict decode of `TCPRouteSpec` | No type under `TCPRouteSpec` unmarshals itself, so the decode reaches every depth. The kind refuses a route without `rules`, a rule without `backendRefs` and a Service backend without its `port`, which the API server refuses too; of a parent and a backend that are authored, the `name` must be written. A parent and a backend of another namespace are written as authored, as the `httproute` kind writes them. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateTLSRoute` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 TLSRoute | kind | `tlsroute` | strict decode of `TLSRouteSpec` | As the `tcproute` row, and the kind refuses a route without `hostnames` too, which the API requires of a TLSRoute. The host names are not held to the allowed registries, and their form is left to the API server. |
| `kubernetes.CreateUDPRoute` | gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 UDPRoute | kind | `udproute` | strict decode of `UDPRouteSpec` | As the `tcproute` row: the decode reaches every depth, the kind refuses a route without `rules`, a rule without `backendRefs` and a Service backend without its `port`, and a parent and a backend of another namespace are written as authored. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `kubernetes.CreateValidatingAdmissionPolicy` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 ValidatingAdmissionPolicy (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | It can deny writes for the whole cluster, and no consumer has asked for it. See "Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration" above. |
| `kubernetes.CreateValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding` | admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1 ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | It puts a ValidatingAdmissionPolicy into effect. See "Held: cluster-wide admission and API registration" above. |

| `certmanager.CreateCertificate` | cert-manager.io/v1 Certificate | kind | `certificate` | strict decode of `CertificateSpec` | Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. `secretName` and `issuerRef` with its `name` must be written. A keystore password in the object is refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets. No capability is required. The `certificate` trait builds a Certificate for a workload through the same constructor, from a hand-written parser. |
| `certmanager.CreateCertificateRequest` | cert-manager.io/v1 CertificateRequest | not authorable | - | - | A one-shot request cert-manager creates for a Certificate. |
| `certmanager.CreateChallenge` | acme.cert-manager.io/v1 Challenge | not authorable | - | - | Created by cert-manager's ACME issuer. |
| `certmanager.CreateClusterIssuer` | cert-manager.io/v1 ClusterIssuer (cluster-scoped) | kind | `clusterissuer` | strict decode of `IssuerSpec` | Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. No top-level field must be written; of an issuer type that is authored, the fields the API requires that the type would write empty. The cpu and memory of an ACME HTTP01 solver's pod template are held to the policy's maxima. No capability is required. |
| `certmanager.CreateIssuer` | cert-manager.io/v1 Issuer | kind | `issuer` | strict decode of `IssuerSpec` | As `clusterissuer`, in the build namespace. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. |

Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. A peer's address is not held to the allowed registries. No environment policy applies. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumBGPNodeConfig` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumBGPNodeConfig (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Generated by the Cilium operator from a CiliumBGPClusterConfig. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumBGPNodeConfigOverride` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumBGPNodeConfigOverride (cluster-scoped) | kind | `cilium-bgpnodeconfigoverride` | strict decode of `CiliumBGPNodeConfigOverrideSpec` | The object overrides the CiliumBGPNodeConfig of the same name: `objectName` sets it where the component name is not that name. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. No environment policy applies. |

| `cilium.CreateCiliumClusterwideEnvoyConfig` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumClusterwideEnvoyConfig (cluster-scoped) | held | - | - | As the CiliumEnvoyConfig row, which shares its spec type, and cluster-scoped: its `resources` are raw Envoy configuration no build-time rule can read, and its `services` forward the traffic of the Services they name to an Envoy listener (go-kure/launcher#790). |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy (cluster-scoped) | kind | `cilium-clusterwidenetworkpolicy` | strict decode of `spec` and `specs` into the Cilium `Rule` | The decode and the unknown-key check of the `cilium-networkpolicy` kind (`builtin.UnknownCiliumKeyPath`). A rule selects endpoints or nodes, exactly one of the two. The fields a rule requires are read from the CRD of the linked module. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. No environment policy applies. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumEgressGatewayPolicy` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumEgressGatewayPolicy (cluster-scoped) | kind | `cilium-egressgatewaypolicy` | strict decode of `CiliumEgressGatewayPolicySpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. The CRD's rule on `egressIP` is a value rule and the API server's. No address or CIDR is held to the allowed registries. No environment policy applies. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumEndpoint` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumEndpoint | not authorable | - | - | Written by the Cilium agent. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumEnvoyConfig` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumEnvoyConfig | held | - | - | Its `resources` are raw Envoy configuration, in the API's words "Envoy xDS resources" (listeners, routes, clusters, endpoints and TLS secrets), each an opaque `Any` the CRD keeps unpruned, and its `services` forward the traffic of the Services they name to an Envoy listener. No build-time rule can read that configuration: the kind would be a way round every rule a policy holds a route, a network policy or a Secret to (go-kure/launcher#790). |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumIdentity` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumIdentity (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Written by Cilium when it allocates an identity. |

Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. The CRD's choice of one frontend matcher is checked; its three rules against a change are the API server's. No environment policy applies. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumNetworkPolicy` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumNetworkPolicy | kind | `cilium-networkpolicy` | strict decode of `spec` and `specs` into the Cilium `Rule` | The endpoint selector, the ICMP field and the rule label unmarshal themselves and drop an unknown key; the kind refuses one by its path at every position that holds any of them (`builtin.UnknownCiliumKeyPath`), and a test holds the list of such types to the Cilium API. The `cilium-networkpolicy` trait builds its own CiliumNetworkPolicy from one rule's `endpointSelector`, `ingress` and `egress`, with the same decode, the same check and the kind's required list cut to those three fields. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumNode` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumNode (cluster-scoped) | not authorable | - | - | Written by the Cilium agent for its node. |
| `cilium.CreateCiliumNodeConfig` | cilium.io/v2 CiliumNodeConfig | kind | `cilium-nodeconfig` | strict decode of `CiliumNodeConfigSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it.

Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. A one-shot request: the API refuses every change of its spec, and applied again it runs nothing. No environment policy applies. |
| `cnpg.CreateCluster` | postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 Cluster | kind | `cnpg-cluster` | strict decode of `ClusterSpec` | `postgresql` lowers onto it. |
| `cnpg.CreateClusterImageCatalog` | postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 ClusterImageCatalog (cluster-scoped) | kind | `cnpg-clusterimagecatalog` | strict decode of `ImageCatalogSpec` | As `cnpg-imagecatalog`, with no namespace. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. |

| `cnpg.CreatePublication` | postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 Publication | kind | `cnpg-publication` | strict decode of `PublicationSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. The CRD's three rules on a target are checked; its four against a change are the API server's. No environment policy applies. |
| `cnpg.CreateScheduledBackup` | postgresql.cnpg.io/v1 ScheduledBackup | kind | `cnpg-scheduledbackup` | strict decode of `ScheduledBackupSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it.

Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties; those of the ExternalSecrets it creates are `externalSecretMetadata`. `externalSecretSpec` must be written, with what an `externalsecret` requires. `externalSecretSpec.target.manifest` is held to the environment policy as on an `externalsecret`. |
| `externalsecrets.CreateClusterSecretStore` | external-secrets.io/v1 ClusterSecretStore (cluster-scoped) | kind | `clustersecretstore` | strict decode of `SecretStoreSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. `provider` must be written with exactly one provider; of that provider, the fields the API requires that the type would write empty, and the four it would default. A credential written as a `value`, and the data of the `fake` provider, are refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets. No capability is required. |
| `externalsecrets.CreateExternalSecret` | external-secrets.io/v1 ExternalSecret | kind | `externalsecret` | strict decode of `ExternalSecretSpec` | Its labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. No top-level field must be written. A generator named as the source of one key of `data` is refused. A `target.manifest` whose `apiVersion` is no API version is refused. A `target.manifest` of a kind the environment policy checks (a workload, a claim, a PersistentVolume, a HorizontalPodAutoscaler) is refused, and a core Secret there under a policy that forbids explicit secrets. No capability is required. The `external-secret` trait builds an ExternalSecret for a workload through the same constructor, from a hand-written parser. |

A source's `namespace` is written as authored. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. No environment policy applies. The type name carries a prefix: an alert, in this package, also reads as an alerting rule. |
| `fluxcd.CreateArtifactGenerator` | source.extensions.fluxcd.io/v1beta1 ArtifactGenerator | kind | `artifactgenerator` | strict decode of `ArtifactGeneratorSpec` | `sources` and `artifacts` must be written; of a source its `alias`, `kind` and `name`, of an artifact its `name` and `copy`, of a copy its `from` and `to`: the fields the linked Go source marks required, not held to a CRD. A source's `namespace` is written as authored. The API's expression rule, which holds an artifact's `name` to an object name where no `pathPattern` is set, is not checked. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. No environment policy applies. |
| `fluxcd.CreateBucket` | source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 Bucket | kind | `bucket` | strict decode of `BucketSpec` | - |
| `fluxcd.CreateExternalArtifact` | source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 ExternalArtifact | not authorable | - | - | Written by the controller that produces the artifact. |
| `fluxcd.CreateFluxInstance` | fluxcd.controlplane.io/v1 FluxInstance | held | - | - | A FluxInstance is the installation of Flux itself, not an application's object: its spec lists "the controllers to install", and the API accepts one name for it, `flux`. A component type would let an application author the cluster's Flux (go-kure/launcher#790). |
| `fluxcd.CreateFluxReport` | fluxcd.controlplane.io/v1 FluxReport | not authorable | - | - | Written by the Flux operator. |
| `fluxcd.CreateGitRepository` | source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 GitRepository | kind | `gitrepository` | strict decode of `GitRepositorySpec` | - |

| `fluxcd.CreateImagePolicy` | image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 ImagePolicy | kind | `imagepolicy` | strict decode of `ImagePolicySpec` | `imageRepositoryRef` with its `name` and `policy` must be written, and of a `semver` policy its `range`: the fields the linked Go source marks required, not held to a CRD. The repository's `namespace` is written as authored. `interval` is held to the pattern of a Flux duration; the API's two expression rules, which tie it to `digestReflectionPolicy: Always`, are not checked. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. No environment policy applies. |
| `fluxcd.CreateImageRepository` | image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 ImageRepository | kind | `imagerepository` | strict decode of `ImageRepositorySpec` | `image` and `interval` must be written, and of an authored `secretRef`, `proxySecretRef` or `certSecretRef` its `name`, of an authored `accessFrom` its `namespaceSelectors`: the fields the linked Go source marks required, not held to a CRD. `interval` and `timeout` are each held to the pattern of their field; `timeout` takes no `h`, and one of an hour or more is written in minutes. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. The registry of `image` is held to the allowed registries of the environment policy; no tag rule applies. |
| `fluxcd.CreateImageUpdateAutomation` | image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 ImageUpdateAutomation | kind | `imageupdateautomation` | strict decode of `ImageUpdateAutomationSpec` | `sourceRef` with its `kind` and `name` and `interval` must be written, and of an authored `git` its `commit` with the author's `email`: the fields the linked Go source marks required, not held to a CRD. `sourceRef.kind` is defaulted by the API and required here, since the type writes it empty. The source's `namespace` is written as authored, and so is where the automation pushes. `interval` is held to the pattern of a Flux duration. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. No environment policy applies. |
| `fluxcd.CreateKustomization` | kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 Kustomization | kind | `fluxcd-kustomization` | strict decode of `KustomizationSpec` | `oci` lowers onto it. `targetNamespace` is never defaulted. |
| `fluxcd.CreateOCIRepository` | source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 OCIRepository | kind | `ocirepository` | strict decode of `OCIRepositorySpec` | `oci` lowers onto it. |
| `fluxcd.CreateProvider` | notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3 Provider | kind | `fluxcd-provider` | strict decode of `ProviderSpec` | `type` must be written, and of an authored `secretRef`, `proxySecretRef` or `certSecretRef` its `name`: the fields the linked Go source marks required, not held to a CRD. `interval` and `timeout` are each held to the pattern of their field; `timeout` takes no `h`, and one of an hour or more is written in minutes. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. A user or a password in `address` or `proxy` is refused; no environment policy applies. |
| `fluxcd.CreateReceiver` | notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 Receiver | kind | `fluxcd-receiver` | strict decode of `ReceiverSpec` | `type` and `resources` must be written, of each resource its `kind` and `name`, of an authored `secretRef` its `name`, and of an OIDC provider its `issuerURL` and `validations` with the fields of each validation and variable: the fields the linked Go source marks required, not held to a CRD. `interval` is held to the pattern of a Flux duration. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. No environment policy applies. |
| `fluxcd.CreateResourceSet` | fluxcd.controlplane.io/v1 ResourceSet | held | - | - | Its `resourcesTemplate` is, in the API's words, "a Go template that generates the list of Kubernetes resources to reconcile". The operator renders it on the cluster, so no build sees the objects and none can be held to a rule: the kind would be a way round every rule a policy holds a workload or a Secret to (go-kure/launcher#790). |
| `fluxcd.CreateResourceSetInputProvider` | fluxcd.controlplane.io/v1 ResourceSetInputProvider | kind | `resourcesetinputprovider` | strict decode of `ResourceSetInputProviderSpec` | `type` must be written, of an authored `secretRef` or `certSecretRef` its `name` and of a schedule its `cron`: the fields the linked Go source marks required. A schedule's `window` is held to the pattern of a Flux duration by its authored text; `filter.limit` cannot be authored as 0, nor a schedule's `timeZone` as empty. It lands in the Flux namespace when one is set. A user or a password in `url` is refused, and the host of `url` is held to the allowed registries of the environment policy. |
| `metallb.CreateBFDProfile` | metallb.io/v1beta1 BFDProfile | kind | `metallb-bfdprofile` | strict decode of `BFDProfileSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it, and a MetalLB BGPPeer refers to it by that name. No field is required. Every field is a pointer, so an authored 0 or false is written; the bounds of the numbers are not checked. It is written in the build namespace; MetalLB reads its objects in the one namespace it is configured to watch, by default the one it runs in. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `metallb.CreateBGPAdvertisement` | metallb.io/v1beta1 BGPAdvertisement | kind | `metallb-bgpadvertisement` | strict decode of `BGPAdvertisementSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it. No field is required: one that authors nothing is the widest advertisement, of every pool, to every peer, for every Service, with no node excluded. A service selector beside an aggregation length other than the API's default is refused, as the CRD's expression rule refuses it. It is written in the build namespace; MetalLB reads its objects in the one namespace it is configured to watch, by default the one it runs in. The communities and the pool and peer names are not read. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `metallb.CreateBGPPeer` | metallb.io/v1beta2 BGPPeer | kind | `metallb-bgppeer` | strict decode of `BGPPeerSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it, and a MetalLB BGPAdvertisement refers to it by that name. `myASN` must be written. A `peerPort: 0` is refused: the type would leave it out and the API server would fill 179. A `connectTime` is held to the CRD's two expression rules; the CRD's rule against a change of `enableGracefulRestart` is the API server's. A `password` is refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets; `passwordSecret` names a Secret and holds no secret, and is written as `{}` where it is not authored. It is written in the build namespace; MetalLB reads its objects in the one namespace it is configured to watch, by default the one it runs in. The addresses and the profile's name are not read. No capability is required. |
| `metallb.CreateCommunity` | metallb.io/v1beta1 Community | kind | `metallb-community` | strict decode of `CommunitySpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it; a MetalLB BGPAdvertisement refers to an alias by the alias's own `name`, not the object's. No field is required, of the spec or of an alias. The form of a value is not read, and neither is a name defined twice. It is written in the build namespace; MetalLB reads its objects in the one namespace it is configured to watch, by default the one it runs in. No capability is required. No environment policy applies. |
| `metallb.CreateConfigurationState` | metallb.io/v1beta1 ConfigurationState | not authorable | - | - | Status MetalLB writes. |
| `metallb.CreateIPAddressPool` | metallb.io/v1beta1 IPAddressPool | kind | `metallb-ipaddresspool` | strict decode of `IPAddressPoolSpec` | The object is named after the component unless `objectName` names it, and a MetalLB advertisement refers to it by that name or selects it by its labels, the `labels` property.

No field is required: one that authors nothing is the widest advertisement, of every pool, on every interface, for every Service, with no node excluded. It is written in the build namespace; MetalLB reads its objects in the one namespace it is configured to watch, by default the one it runs in. The pool and interface names are not read.

An image the operator chooses, for `alertmanager` or one of its two reloaders, is refused under a policy with allowed registries. `podMetadata` is read for reserved keys and takes no label: the operator's pods carry the component label only where the author writes it there.

## Adding a kind component: where its lines go

A change that adds a kind component adds one entry to each of the lists below. Such changes
are written side by side, and two of them merge without a conflict only where their new
lines land between different neighbours. So a new entry goes **at the position of its
component type**, in the order `sort.Strings` gives (`cilium-nodeconfig` before
`clusterissuer`, `pod` before `poddisruptionbudget`), and never at the end of the list.

| List | Where | Held in order by |
|---|---|---|
| `ComponentHandlers` | `pkg/oam/builtin/registry/registry.go` | `TestKindLists_InOrder` (`pkg/cmd/kurel`) |
| `validComponentTypes` | `pkg/oam/validate.go` | `TestKindLists_InOrder` |
| `wantHandlers`, `componentLabelFixtures` | the tests of `pkg/cmd/kurel` | `TestKindLists_InOrder` |
| `coreKindSchemas`, `apiSetKinds` | the tests of this package | `TestKindLists_InOrder`; `TestKindLists_Complete` fails on a registered type with no row and no reason in `kindListExceptions` |
| `parityKinds`, for a kind excepted there because it reads its own properties (`ownProperties`) | `hand_parsed_parity_internal_test.go` | not in order; `TestKindLists_OwnPropertiesHaveParityRows` (`pkg/cmd/kurel`) fails on a type with that reason and no row, and on a row of a type without it |
| `policyFreeKinds` and the two maps of its tests, for a kind built on `policyFreeKind` | the tests of this package | `TestKindLists_InOrder` |
| `requiredWrittenKinds`, for a kind whose API is a CRD a linked module ships or whose markers are read; `monitoringKinds`, for a kind of the Prometheus operator's API | the tests of this package | `TestKindLists_InOrder`. `testdata/required-written-not-refused.txt` is written in the order of `requiredWrittenKinds`, so a new kind's lines land at its position when it is regenerated |
| `imageFieldTypes`, for a spec type a kind decodes that names an image | `image_fields_internal_test.go` | `TestKindLists_InOrder`, in the order of the entries' `name` |
| `kindTraitPairs`, for a kind a trait also generates | the tests of `pkg/cmd/kurel` | `TestKindLists_InOrder`, in the order of the entries' `typ` |
| `policyFreeTypes`, for a kind built on `policyFreeKind` whose type publishes its field comments | `kind_policy_free_internal_test.go` | no test: its rows name the kind's value, not its type, and a new row goes at the end. A kind with no row is not held by `TestPolicyFreeKinds_NoDefaultedZeros` |
| "Component types" | this file | `TestKindLists_InOrder` |
| "Component type allowlist" | `pkg/oam/README.md` | `TestKindLists_InOrder`; `TestKindLists_Complete` fails on a type of `validComponentTypes` with no row and on a row of no type of it |
| Table 4.2 | `docs/oam/design-kurel-package.md` | `TestKindLists_InOrder` |
| The table of kind components under "`kurel build`" | `pkg/cmd/kurel/README.md` | `TestKindLists_InOrder` |
| "Per-type highlights" | this file | no test, and not yet in order: a new entry goes before the first entry whose head names a type that sorts after its own |
| The "Shipped" entries of §6.2 that ship kinds | `docs/delivery-scope.md` | no test: the same position, before the entries that are not "Shipped" |

In the Go lists an entry names its component type by a string literal, not by a constant (a
struct written with field names, in its `component` field or the one `kindListKeyFields` in
`pkg/cmd/kurel` names for its list): `TestKindLists_InOrder` reads the source file, and stops
on an entry whose type it cannot read.

What belongs to one kind goes in that kind's own files, not at the end of a shared one: the
handler, its `ContractMetadata` and `ComponentObject` methods (not `contract.go`,
`object_name.go`), its tests, and the helpers only its entries in a shared list use, which go
in its own test file rather than beside the list.

No sentence names every kind. A sentence that needs the set points at the "Kind inventory",
which its tests hold complete. One table names every component type, one row each: the
"Component type allowlist" of `pkg/oam/README.md`. A change that adds a type to
`validComponentTypes` adds its row there, so it changes the README that CI's documentation
check requires of a change to `pkg/oam`.

Six places still conflict, and there the change that lands second is rebased on the first
before it is published:

- `policyFreeTypes`, where two changes each add a row at the end;
- two changes that add kinds at the same position of a list, with no existing entry between
  them (two more `cilium-*` kinds, say);
- a map whose values `gofmt` aligns (`ComponentHandlers`, `validComponentTypes`,
  `kindListExceptions`), when a new type is longer than every type the map holds: every
  entry is realigned, which conflicts with any other change to that map;
- the "Kind inventory", where a new kind edits its row in place (`missing` to `kind`): two
  changes that edit neighbouring rows;
- the entries of §6.2 of `docs/delivery-scope.md` that are not "Shipped" (a "Held" entry,
  "Missing kinds"), which have no order: two changes that each add one at the same place,
  or that edit the same one;
- the import block of a file both changes add an import to.

## Common config

`env`, `command`, `args`, `initContainers`, `sidecars` and `affinity` each read
their property with a bare comma-ok type assertion and, when that failed,
returned the zero value with no error. So a property authored with the **wrong
container type** — a mapping where the schema wants a list, a list or scalar
where it wants an object — built cleanly and emitted nothing for the property,
and nothing in the output said it had been seen. Closed in go-kure/launcher#423
by routing those six through presence-reporting helpers (`common.go`), which
report presence separately from value, so each of the six now rejects a
mistyped value by name instead of discarding it. (go-kure/launcher#444 later
folded the dedicated `optionalObject`/`optionalObjectList`/`optionalStringList`
wrappers those six originally used into the base `parseObjectField`/
`parseStringField`/etc. helpers themselves — callers now use the base helpers
directly, and the null-as-absence behavior applies uniformly rather than only
through the wrappers.) Those helpers were already how several other properties on the
same components are read — `updateStrategy` and `ordinals` on `statefulset`
(`statefulset_spec.go`), `successPolicy` and `podFailurePolicy` on `job` and
`cronjob` (`common.go`) — so the six behaved differently from properties an
author writes beside them in the same document. This covers those six parsers;
it is not a claim that every property in this package is read through the
helpers.

An `env` entry with no usable `name` is an error at every position, not only
at the top level. The published schema marks `env[].name` required, but that
check reached only a top-level `env` list: an `env` list nested inside an
`initContainers` or `sidecars` entry sat in an open object the schema did not
describe, and `parseEnv` then skipped a nameless entry, so the container was
emitted with the variable missing and nothing reported. `parseEnv` now refuses
it itself, whether or not the schema layer reaches that position —
`env[0]: name is required` for an absent, empty or null `name`, and
`env[0].name: must be a string, got int` for a non-string one — so the rule
holds for any caller, including one that hands properties to a handler without
schema validation. **Behavior-changing** under `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`:
a document authoring such an entry inside `initContainers`/`sidecars` built
before (with the variable dropped) and is now rejected, and so is a top-level
entry with `name: ""` — schema validation checks only that `name` is present
and a string, so the empty name reached `parseEnv` and was skipped the same
way. A top-level entry with `name` absent or null was already refused by
schema validation and still is (go-kure/launcher#447).

A required string field given a value of the wrong type is reported as a type
error, not as missing. Fourteen required-string reads used to discard a failed
type assertion and then test for `""`, so `fieldPath: 123` produced
`fieldRef: fieldPath is required` and sent the author looking for a lost key.
They now read through `requiredStringField` (or `parseStringField` directly
where the existing message is kept verbatim), and each field gets its own
messages: `fieldRef.fieldPath: must be a string, got int` for a wrong type, and
`fieldRef: fieldPath is required` only for an absent, empty or null value. The
fields are `env[].valueFrom.fileKeyRef.volumeName`/`.path`/`.key`,
`valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath`, `valueFrom.resourceFieldRef.resource`,
`envFrom[].configMapRef.name` and `.secretRef.name`, the `name` and `image` of
an `initContainers`/`sidecars` entry and the `name`/`mountPath` of its
`volumeMounts`, `manifests`
`scopeOverrides[].apiVersion`/`.kind`, and `oci` `source.url` and `version`.
`fileKeyRef`, `volumeMounts` and `scopeOverrides` used to report their fields
together ("volumeName, path, and key are all required"), so a wrong type on
one looked like any of them might be missing; each field is now named on its
own. What is accepted is unchanged: every one of these values was rejected
before and still is, and only the message changed. For a document run through
schema validation, the schema already refuses a non-string at every one of
these positions, so the parser message is what a caller sees that hands
properties to a handler without schema validation (go-kure/launcher#453).

**The main container is named after the component, so a workload component
name must be a DNS-1123 *label*, not merely a subdomain.** A component name is
validated as a DNS-1123 subdomain (`pkg/oam/validate.go`), which permits dots,
and that name reaches `metadata.name` unchanged and the `app:` label through
`oam.ComponentLabelValue` (the name itself at 63 characters or fewer) — both
accept it. It also becomes the name of the pod's main container, and a
container name is a DNS-1123 label, which forbids dots and allows at most 63
characters where a subdomain allows 253. `batch.worker` would therefore build
a workload the API server rejects at admission, naming
`spec.template.spec.containers[0].name`, a field the author never wrote; an
undotted name longer than 63 characters is refused by the same check. All
seven workload kinds (`webservice`, `worker`, `deployment`, `statefulset`,
`daemonset`, `cronjob`, `job`) now refuse such a name at generation, in the one
builder they share. The name is refused rather than rewritten to `batch-worker`:
a derived name would silently rename the container and could collide with an
init container or sidecar of that name. Component types that name no container
after the component (`helmrelease`, `manifests`, `passthrough`, …) keep accepting
a dotted or longer name, so the component-name rule itself is unchanged. `job` refused
the name from its introduction; the other six gained the check in
go-kure/launcher#407. Nothing that previously produced an applyable manifest is
affected — such a document never did. A kind that also names a Service after
the component (`webservice`) refuses a dotted or longer name earlier, at
conversion, by the stricter Service-name rule described under each kind in
"Per-type highlights" (go-kure/launcher#546). `daemonset` and `statefulset`
named one too until they stopped emitting a Service (go-kure/launcher#690).
`cronjob` and `job` refuse a name past the length of their own object earlier
too, at conversion: a CronJob's name is at most 52 characters, a Job's at most
63 (see each kind in "Per-type highlights").

Most workload types (`webservice`, `worker`, `deployment`, `statefulset`,
`daemonset`, `cronjob`, `job`)
share these fields, projected directly onto real `corev1` types (same
structural pattern as `ProbeConfig` holding `*corev1.Probe`) rather than a
hand-rolled parallel schema: `image` (validated — no untagged/`latest`), `env`
(`value` or `valueFrom` — mutually exclusive, matching `corev1.EnvVar`'s own
doc comment ("cannot be used if value is not empty"); `valueFrom` is one of
`secretKeyRef`, `configMapKeyRef` (both accept `optional`, rejecting a
present non-boolean value rather than silently treating it as unset; a key
other than `name`/`key`/`optional` in either is rejected outright too, rather
than being silently ignored), `fieldRef`
(`apiVersion` must be `v1` if authored — the only field-label conversion
Kubernetes has ever shipped for the downward API; omitting it also defaults to
`v1`; a present-but-non-string `apiVersion` (e.g. a bare YAML number) is
rejected rather than silently treated as absent (`parseStringField`);
`fieldPath` is validated against the exact set real admission accepts
for an env var fieldRef — `metadata.name`/`metadata.namespace`/`metadata.uid`,
`spec.nodeName`/`spec.serviceAccountName`, `status.hostIP`/`status.hostIPs`/
`status.podIP`/`status.podIPs` — plus the `metadata.labels['KEY']`/
`metadata.annotations['KEY']` subscript forms, each with `KEY` checked as a
qualified name; a field like `status.phase` builds but is rejected by
admission, so it is rejected here too; a key other than `fieldPath`/
`apiVersion` is rejected outright too, rather than being silently ignored),
`resourceFieldRef` (`resource` must be
one of `limits.cpu`, `limits.memory`, `limits.ephemeral-storage`,
`requests.cpu`, `requests.memory`, `requests.ephemeral-storage`, or a
`requests.hugepages-<size>`/`limits.hugepages-<size>` selector — the downward
API cannot project an arbitrary extended resource such as
`limits.nvidia.com/gpu`, unlike a plain `resources` map below; an authored
`divisor` must be one of the canonical unit strings admission accepts for that
resource's family — `1m`/`1` for cpu, one of `1`/`1k`/`1M`/`1G`/`1T`/`1P`/`1E`/
`1Ki`/`1Mi`/`1Gi`/`1Ti`/`1Pi`/`1Ei` for memory/ephemeral-storage/hugepages — a
zero-valued divisor such as `"0"` is rejected outright rather than silently
treated as absent: Kubernetes' own zero-value defaulting substitutes 1 for a
zero divisor, so silently accepting one would change the emitted unit without
the author asking for it; a present-but-non-string
divisor (e.g. a bare YAML number) is rejected rather than silently treated as
absent (`parseStringField`);
`containerName`, if authored,
must be a syntactically valid container name (`ValidateDNS1123Label`) —
**note:** whether it actually names a container present in the generated pod
is deliberately not checked, since that needs the full sibling
container/initContainer/sidecar name set, which isn't available at this
single-env-var parsing depth; real admission doesn't check it either (only
the downward API *volume* form of `resourceFieldRef` requires
`containerName` at all), so an unresolvable target only surfaces later, as a
kubelet-time `CreateContainerConfigError`; a key other than
`resource`/`containerName`/`divisor` is rejected outright rather than
silently ignored, since a typo such as `divisorr` would otherwise leave the
divisor unset — Kubernetes treats a zero divisor as its default of 1,
changing the emitted unit),
`fileKeyRef` (`volumeName`/`path`/`key` required, `optional` accepted (same
non-boolean rejection as above); corev1's `EnvFiles` feature; `volumeName`
must be a valid DNS-1123 label and `key` a valid (relaxed) env var name,
matching real admission's own `validateFileKeySelector`; `path` must be
relative and must not contain a `..` backstep component, per this repo's own
path-safety convention; once the component's `volumes` are parsed,
`volumeName` must name one of them of type `emptyDir` — a `fileKeyRef` in
the main container, an init container or a sidecar naming an undeclared
volume (a statefulset claim template included) or a non-`emptyDir` one is
refused, as real admission's `validateFileKeyRefVolumes` refuses it (no
trait the build evaluates adds an `emptyDir` volume; a patch a consumer
applies at delivery is outside the build's view, so a volume only a patch supplies is not
seen — declare the `emptyDir` volume on the component itself; see
`checkFileKeyRefVolumes` in `common.go`); a
key other than `volumeName`/`path`/`key`/`optional` is rejected outright too,
rather than being silently ignored) —
mutually exclusive among themselves too), `envFrom` (an authored non-array
value, e.g. a single ConfigMap/Secret object instead of a list of them, is
rejected rather than silently treated as absent; bulk-import a ConfigMap's
or Secret's keys, with `prefix` — any printable ASCII character except `=`,
matching `corev1.EnvFromSource.Prefix`'s own field doc comment; only the final
prefix+key concatenation need be a valid env var name, not the prefix alone;
a present-but-non-string `prefix` (e.g. a bare YAML number) is rejected
rather than silently omitted while still emitting the rest of the source —
an unprefixed import can collide with existing names and leaves the names
the application expects unset;
`configMapRef.name`/`secretRef.name` must each be a valid DNS-1123 subdomain,
matching how every Kubernetes object name is validated; both `configMapRef`
and `secretRef` also accept `optional`, with the same non-boolean rejection
as `env`'s `secretKeyRef`/`configMapKeyRef` above; a key other than
`name`/`optional` inside either nested ref (e.g. a misspelled `optoinal`) is
rejected outright too, rather than silently leaving the ref at its required
default; a present-but-malformed
`configMapRef`/`secretRef` (e.g. a scalar instead of an object) is rejected
outright rather than silently treated as absent — the latter would let the
other, well-formed ref alone satisfy the "exactly one" check below and
quietly discard the malformed one instead of reporting it); a key other
than `prefix`/`configMapRef`/`secretRef` (e.g. a misspelled `prefx`) is
rejected outright too, rather than being silently ignored while the rest of
the entry still builds — on `prefix` specifically, that previously emitted
an unprefixed import instead of the intended one),
`resources` — a `corev1.ResourceRequirements` projection read with
`parseObjectField`, as are its `requests` and `limits`: a present value of the
wrong type (`resources: "big"`, `requests: 3`) is **rejected by name**
(`resources: must be an object, got string`) by each of the eight kinds that accept `resources` (webservice, worker,
deployment, statefulset, daemonset, cronjob, job, postgresql) and by each
`initContainers`/`sidecars` entry, and a null reads as absence. Until
go-kure/launcher#405 all three were read with a bare comma-ok assertion, so a
handler called directly — without the schema validation an authored document
gets first, which already refused these shapes — dropped the value and emitted
a container with no requests or limits. `requests`/`limits`
accept `cpu`/`memory` (defaults 100m/128Mi — subject to the environment
policy's `MaxCPU()`/`MaxMemory()` maxima the same as an authored value; see
"Policy defaults & enforcement ordering" below) plus any other well-formed
resource name (e.g. `ephemeral-storage`, `nvidia.com/gpu`) in the same map,
each value authored as either a quantity string (`"500m"`, `"2Gi"`) or a bare
YAML/JSON number (`1`, `0.5`) — both are valid `resource.Quantity` input
(`Quantity.UnmarshalJSON` parses a bare numeric literal the same way it parses
a quoted one), and both forms are also accepted by the published property
schema itself: `cpu`/`memory` are declared as the `Types: [string, number]`
union (go-kure/launcher#383), so a value of any other type is rejected by
property validation before the parser sees it — parsed as `resource.Quantity` and
round-tripped unmodified. A resource name is validated the same way real
admission validates `corev1.Container.Resources` (mirrors
`ValidateContainerResourceName`): an unqualified name (no `/`) must be
`cpu`/`memory`/`ephemeral-storage` or a `hugepages-<size>` name — an arbitrary
unqualified token such as `foo` builds but is reserved for Kubernetes' own
native resources and is rejected here too; a qualified name (has `/`) is
accepted as an extended resource (e.g. `nvidia.com/gpu`) unless it either
contains `kubernetes.io/` (which claims to be a native resource, not an
extended one, mirroring `IsNativeResource`) or is `requests.`-prefixed (which
collides with the `ResourceQuota` `requests.<name>` alias form) — the two
conditions are checked independently, so e.g. `kubernetes.io/foo` is rejected
even though it is not `requests.`-prefixed.
Every quantity must be non-negative; `cpu`/`memory`/`storage`/
`ephemeral-storage` may be fractional, but any other (extended) resource name
must be a whole number, matching Kubernetes' own extended-resource
constraint. A `hugepages-<size>` quantity must additionally be an integer
multiple of that page size (e.g. `hugepages-2Mi: 3Mi` is a whole number of
bytes but not a whole number of 2Mi pages, and is rejected; `hugepages-2Mi:
4Mi` is accepted), matching `IsHugePageResourceValueDivisible`. A hugepages
or extended resource cannot be overcommitted (mirrors
`validateResourceRequirements`'s `IsOvercommitAllowed` check): if `requests`
sets one, `limits` must set the identical value for that same name — a
request with no matching limit is rejected outright (nothing defaults a
missing limit from a request, unlike cpu/memory), and a request/limit pair
that merely differs is rejected too. A `limits`-only entry with no matching
`requests` entry is deliberately not rejected here: the real apiserver's
defaulter copies `limits` into `requests` before validation runs, so that
shape is admission-valid. `cpu`/`memory`/`ephemeral-storage` stay
overcommittable — a lower request than limit is fine, and either may be set
without the other — but when both are present the request still must not
*exceed* the limit, matching `validateResourceRequirements`'s
request-vs-limit comparison for every resource name, not just the
non-overcommitable set. Admission's "HugePages require cpu or memory" rule
(a block naming a `hugepages-<size>` resource must also name cpu or memory,
on either side) is not checked here, because a container's final resources
always carry the cpu/memory requests `buildResourceRequirements` defaults in;
it is checked where a block reaches the cluster without those defaults —
`podResources` at parse time, and the postgresql Cluster's `resources` at
generation time. No policy
default/max hook exists for names other than cpu/memory
today; the container-level `claims` list (Dynamic Resource Allocation) is
deliberately not covered — it only *references* pod-level claims by name, and
the pod-level `resourceClaims` property that declares them is now accepted
(see Pod-level properties below, go-kure/launcher#342), so what remains
missing is the container-side reference list alone, tracked with the rest of
DRA support, see `parseResources`'s doc comment. An authored `claims` is
refused by name, whatever its value, on the main container and on an
`initContainers` or `sidecars` entry — `resources.claims: not read by this
component — …` — and no longer dropped for a caller that skips the document
check; see
[Upstream fields a hand-parsed kind does not read](#upstream-fields-a-hand-parsed-kind-does-not-read)),
`command`/`args` (must be an
array, and each element must be a string — both are rejected outright rather
than silently discarded. Until go-kure/launcher#423 they were mishandled twice
over: a mistyped `command: /bin/sh -c true` fell through their comma-ok guard
and the container built with no command at all, and `command: [ls, 3]` emitted
`["ls"]` and said nothing about the `3`. Closing it changed their signature to
return an error, which is why the fix touches all 9 call sites — the seven
workload kinds' own main containers, plus `initContainers` and `sidecars` in
`common.go`), `probes`
(rejected outright if authored with a non-object value, e.g. `probes: true`,
and likewise for each of its own `readiness`/`liveness`/`startup` keys, e.g.
`probes: {liveness: true}` — same two-level presence-then-type-check shape as
`lifecycle` below, instead of silently discarding the authored health check;
a key other than `readiness`/`liveness`/`startup` (e.g. a misspelled
`probes: {live: {...}}`) is rejected outright too, rather than matching none
of the three recognized keys and silently producing no probe at all; a key
other than the ten recognized fields inside a single probe object — the four
handlers below plus the six timing fields further down — (e.g. a misspelled
`failureTreshold`) is rejected outright too, instead of silently falling
back to Kubernetes' own default for the field the typo was meant to
override;
httpGet/tcpSocket/exec/grpc — exactly one handler may be authored; a
present-but-non-object value for any of the four (e.g. `httpGet: "invalid"`)
is rejected outright, even when paired with a well-formed sibling handler,
rather than silently discarded while the sibling wins; an authored probe
object with none of the four handlers present (e.g. `probes: {liveness:
{periodSeconds: 10}}`) is rejected too, matching real admission
(`validateHandler`'s `numHandlers == 0` check) instead of silently discarding
the whole authored probe; `exec.command` must be
a non-empty array of strings — a present-but-wrong-type `command` (e.g. a
bare string instead of an array) or an array containing a non-string element
is rejected the same way, instead of silently producing no probe at all,
mirroring `lifecycle.{postStart,preStop}.exec.command` below; a key other
than `command` inside a probe `exec` object (e.g. a misspelled `commnad`) is
rejected outright too, instead of silently ignored while the intended
command never overrides the default; a string `port` is a named container port, not
an arbitrary label, and is validated against `validation.IsValidPortName`
just as real admission's `ValidatePortNumOrName` does: lowercase
`[-a-z0-9]` only, at least one letter, no leading/trailing/adjacent hyphen,
max 15 characters — a purely numeric string like `"8080"` is rejected, since
it has no letter; beyond syntax, a named port is rejected outright on a
component kind whose main container never declares any port for the kubelet
to resolve the name against — `worker` and `cronjob` unconditionally (neither
exposes a `port` property at all), `daemonset`/`statefulset` only when their
own optional `port` was not set on that component instance (their main
container is named `"http"`/`"tcp"` respectively, but only when `port > 0`),
and `webservice` never (its `port` always defaults to 80, so the main
container is always named `"http"`) — a numeric port is unaffected either way,
since it dials the kubelet directly rather than resolving a declared name.
(Those rules predate `ports`, and the `port` they describe on `daemonset` and
`statefulset` is gone (go-kure/launcher#690). Today `deployment`, `daemonset`,
`statefulset`, `job` and `cronjob` resolve a named port against the main
container's `ports` list, refusing a name that list does not declare and any
named port when it is empty; see "Main container ports".)
Where a named port is allowed at all, it is further checked against the
exact names the main container actually declares — `"http"` for
`webservice`, the authored `ports` names on the kinds above — not merely accepted as
any syntactically valid name: a syntactically valid but different name (e.g.
`httpGet.port: metrics` on a `webservice`, whose only declared container
port is `"http"`) builds successfully but is exactly as unresolvable by the
kubelet at runtime as a named port on a portless component, so it is
rejected the same way; `grpc.service`, if authored, must be a string — a
present-but-non-string value (e.g. `service: 123`) is rejected rather than
silently treated as absent (which would check the overall server instead of
the intended named service) — and must be no more than 63
characters (mirrors `validateGRPCService`'s length cap — the gRPC
health-checking service name is not DNS-1123 formatted, but admission still
bounds its length), and `grpc.port` is always numeric regardless of any
kind's named-port rules — a named `grpc.port` is rejected outright with its
own message, never resolved against a declared container port; a key other
than `port`/`service` inside a probe `grpc` object (e.g. a misspelled
`servcie`) is rejected outright too, instead of silently ignored;
`tcpSocket.host`, if authored, is preserved on the probe — a
present-but-non-string value (e.g. `host: 123`) is rejected
(`parseStringField`), instead of silently
discarded while the probe still dials the Pod IP; when omitted,
`corev1.TCPSocketAction.Host`'s own doc comment says it then defaults to the
Pod IP, so no explicit default needs to be authored here — the same
optional-override shape as `httpGet.host` below; a key other than
`port`/`host` inside a probe `tcpSocket` object (e.g. a misspelled `hots`)
is rejected outright too, instead of silently ignored;
`httpGet.httpHeaders` itself and its entries are validated
rather than silently dropped/coerced — an authored non-array `httpHeaders`
value (e.g. a single header object instead of a list) is rejected the same
as a non-object entry within it, a missing/empty/invalid `name`
(`validation.IsHTTPHeaderName`, matching `validateHTTPGetAction`), or a
present-but-non-string `value` are all rejected instead of quietly
disappearing or turning into `""`; a key other than `name`/`value` in a
header entry (e.g. a misspelled `vaule`) is rejected outright too, rather
than being silently ignored; an omitted `value` key still defaults to
`""` — shared by `lifecycle.{postStart,preStop}.httpGet` below via the same
parsing helper; a key other than `port`/`path`/`host`/`scheme`/`httpHeaders`
anywhere in an httpGet object (e.g. a misspelled `pth` for `path`) is
rejected outright too, instead of silently ignored while Kubernetes defaults
whatever field the typo was meant to override — the identical five-key
allow-list is checked independently in `lifecycle.{postStart,preStop}.httpGet`
below, which has its own copy of this handler; `path`/`host`/`scheme` are
all optional — an absent or empty
`path` matches real Kubernetes' own defaulting (`SetDefaults_HTTPGetAction`
fills it with `"/"` before validation ever runs, wired for both probe and
lifecycle httpGet handlers), so this schema does not require what upstream
itself fills in; `host` has no format validation in real admission either
(only rejected in combination with an HTTP2 protocol, which this schema does
not expose), so an unusual-looking host string is accepted verbatim, same as
real admission; `scheme`, if authored, must be `HTTP` or `HTTPS`
(case-insensitive); all three, plus every probe numeric field below, reject a
present-but-wrong-type value instead of silently treating it as absent;
`initialDelaySeconds`/`periodSeconds`/`timeoutSeconds`/`successThreshold`/
`failureThreshold`/`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` are typed integers, each
bounds-checked to match real Kubernetes admission (`validateProbeTimeouts`
plus the liveness/startup `successThreshold` rule) rather than accepting any
integer at face value: `initialDelaySeconds` must not be negative;
`periodSeconds`/`timeoutSeconds`/`successThreshold`/`failureThreshold` must
each be at least 1 (a `periodSeconds: 0`, for example, would otherwise author
a probe Kubernetes itself would reject); `successThreshold` must additionally
be exactly 1 on a liveness or startup probe — only a readiness probe may set
it above 1, since liveness/startup have only two outcomes (still healthy,
or restart) and "N consecutive successes to reset that state" has no defined
meaning for either —
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is additionally rejected outright on a
readiness probe (a failed readiness check only pulls the pod from Service
endpoints, it never terminates the container, so the field has nothing to
apply to there) and must be at least 1 when set on a liveness or startup
probe), `lifecycle` (rejected outright if authored with a non-object value,
e.g. a scalar or array, instead of silently treating it as absent and
running the container with no startup/shutdown hooks; a key other than
`postStart`/`preStop` (e.g. a misspelled `lifecycle: {postStop: {...}}`) is
rejected outright too, rather than matching neither recognized key and
silently producing no hook at all;
`postStart`/`preStop`:
`exec` (every `command` element must be a string; a non-string element is
rejected, not silently dropped; a key other than `command` in the object,
e.g. a misspelled `commnad`, is rejected outright too, instead of silently
ignored)/`httpGet` (same named-port, `httpHeaders`,
unknown-key, and optional-`path`/`host`/`scheme` rules as `probes`
above)/`sleep` (`seconds` is required and must be a non-negative integer; a
key other than `seconds` in the object, e.g. a misspelled `sconds`, is
rejected outright too, instead of silently ignored) — at
most one of these three may be authored, and a present-but-non-object value
for any of them is rejected outright rather than silently discarded while a
well-formed sibling wins, same as `probes` above;
`tcpSocket` is rejected unconditionally, even when paired with another valid
handler such as `exec`, and regardless of its own value's shape (an
authored-but-malformed `tcpSocket`, e.g. a string, is rejected the same as a
well-formed one) — corev1 documents it as broken for lifecycle hooks,
and simply ignoring the extra key would silently drop the authored
`tcpSocket` while emitting only the other handler; a key on a `postStart`/
`preStop` value outside `httpGet`/`exec`/`sleep`/`tcpSocket` itself (e.g. a
misspelled `timeoutSeconds` alongside a valid `exec`) is rejected outright
too, rather than being silently ignored while the valid sibling handler
still builds; `postStart`/`preStop` are
each rejected outright if present with a non-object value, e.g. `preStop:
"flush"`, instead of silently discarding the whole hook),
`securityContext` (rejected outright if authored with a non-object value,
e.g. a scalar or array, instead of silently treating it as absent and
emitting a container with a nil security context; a key other than the
eleven recognized security-context fields (e.g. a misspelled
`readOnlyRootFileSystem`) is rejected outright too, instead of matching none
of them and silently discarding the whole hardening request;
per-container: `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup`/`runAsNonRoot`
(`runAsUser: 0` combined with `runAsNonRoot: true` builds and is admitted by
the API server, but the kubelet's `verifyRunAsNonRoot` check deterministically
fails it at container-start time — a `CreateContainerConfigError`, every
time — so this contradictory combination is rejected here instead of
shipping a workload guaranteed never to start; `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup` are
each rejected if authored with a non-integer value, e.g. a quoted `"1000"`,
rather than silently omitting the UID/GID — since the container would then
fall back to the image's own default, which may be root, while looking like
the authored value was honored; both must also be non-negative),
`readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation`, `privileged` (these
three, plus `runAsNonRoot` above, are each rejected outright if authored with
a non-boolean value, e.g. a quoted `"false"`, instead of being silently
skipped: since Kubernetes' default for each is permissive, silently dropping
a mistyped value would leave the container permissive while looking like the
authored hardening request was honored; additionally, `privileged: true`
combined with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` is rejected outright —
`corev1.SecurityContext.AllowPrivilegeEscalation`'s own field doc states it
is always true once a container runs privileged, so the pair would claim a
hardening guarantee the runtime cannot honor, the same contradiction shape as
`runAsUser: 0` with `runAsNonRoot: true` above),
`capabilities` (rejected if authored with a non-object value; a key other
than `add`/`drop` in the object, e.g. a misspelled `dorp`, is rejected
outright too, instead of silently ignored; `add`/`drop`
are each rejected if authored with a non-array value, e.g. `drop: ALL`
instead of a list, or with a non-string array element — an empty-string
element is silently skipped rather than rejected, since real admission places
no format constraint on a Capability string at all. Adding the literal
capability `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` alongside `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` is
rejected outright — Kubernetes admission always treats a container holding
that capability as privilege-escalated regardless of the field's own value,
so the combination promises hardening the runtime cannot honor; the
unprefixed conventional form `SYS_ADMIN` is not rejected, matching real
admission's own exact-string scope (it checks only `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`,
literally). `add` is checked against the environment policy's
`AllowedContainerCapabilities`/`ForbiddenContainerCapabilities` accessor pair
(`enforceContainerCapabilities` in `enforce.go`) — a separate pair from
`oam.Policy`'s `AllowedCapabilities`/`ForbiddenCapabilities`/
`RequiredCapabilities`, which gate OAM trait-type usage (e.g. "ingress"), not
container Linux capability strings (e.g. "NET_ADMIN"); see `enforce.go`'s
`enforcePrivileged` doc comment for the naming-collision detail.
Default-allow, forbidden-list-first semantics: a nil/empty `Allowed` list
means no restriction and a nil/empty `Forbidden` list means no forbids, but a
capability present in both is rejected — forbidden always wins. `drop` is
never checked against policy — dropping a capability is strictly hardening.
Both the authored value and every policy-list entry are normalised
(upper-cased, `CAP_` prefix stripped) before comparison, so `NET_ADMIN`,
`CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `net_admin` are treated as the same capability on both
sides; `ALL` is special-cased symmetrically on both sides. An authored entry
that normalises to `ALL` is rejected whenever `Forbidden` is non-empty, even
if no entry normalising to `ALL` is itself listed in `Forbidden`, since `ALL`
necessarily grants every forbidden capability. Conversely, a `Forbidden`
entry that normalises to `ALL` rejects every authored `add` entry
unconditionally — `forbidden: ["ALL"]` means no capability may be added at
all, regardless of what `Allowed` says), `seccompProfile` (rejected outright if authored with
a non-object value, e.g. `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`, instead of silently skipping the field
and dropping the requested sandboxing entirely; a key other than
`type`/`localhostProfile` in the object, e.g. a misspelled `locahost`, is
rejected outright too, instead of silently ignored; `type` is required whenever the
`seccompProfile` object is authored at all, matching real admission's own
`field.Required` — omitting it (e.g. authoring only `localhostProfile` with
no `type` key) is rejected rather than silently discarding the whole
profile; `localhostProfile` is rejected outright when authored alongside
`type: RuntimeDefault`/`Unconfined` (only meaningful for `type: Localhost`),
including a present-but-non-string value in that position (e.g.
`localhostProfile: 123`) — the present-but-wrong-type value is rejected
(`parseStringField`), not silently treated as
absent while the contradictory type is accepted as authored; when `type` is
`Localhost`, `localhostProfile` must be
relative and must not contain a `..` backstep component, matching
`corev1.SeccompProfile.LocalhostProfile`'s own doc comment — "must be a
descending path, relative to the kubelet's configured seccomp profile
location" — and this repo's own path-safety convention), `seLinuxOptions`
(also rejected outright if authored with a non-object value, same reasoning as
`seccompProfile` above; a key other than `user`/`role`/`type`/`level` in the
object, e.g. a misspelled `tpye`, is rejected outright too, instead of
silently ignored;
`user`/`role`/`type`/`level` are each rejected if authored with a
non-string value, e.g. `type: 123`, instead of silently discarding just that
sub-field — if it were the only one set, the whole SELinux context would
otherwise vanish rather than reporting the malformed input),
`appArmorProfile` (same "`type` required when authored" rule as
`seccompProfile` above, the same non-object rejection as `seccompProfile`
and `seLinuxOptions`, the same unknown-key rejection (only
`type`/`localhostProfile` are recognized) as `seccompProfile` above, and the
same `localhostProfile`
mutual-exclusivity-with-RuntimeDefault/Unconfined and present-but-non-string
rejection as `seccompProfile` above), `procMount` (`Default`|`Unmasked`; a present-but-non-string
value, e.g. `procMount: false`, is rejected rather than silently omitted
(`parseStringField`); an explicit empty
string is still treated as absent, not an error, which is `parseStringField`'s
own convention), `windowsOptions` (`gmsaCredentialSpecName`,
`gmsaCredentialSpec`, `runAsUserName` and `hostProcess`, the closed key set the
pod-level `podSecurityContext.windowsOptions` reads, go-kure/launcher#790; an
`os.name: linux` pod refuses it, as it refuses the pod-level one. Its strings
are held to upstream's `validateWindowsSecurityContextOptions`, at both
levels: `gmsaCredentialSpecName` is a DNS-1123 subdomain, `gmsaCredentialSpec`
is at most 64 KiB, and `runAsUserName` is `USER` or `DOMAIN\USER` with no
control character, a domain under 256 characters in the NetBIOS or the DNS
format, and a user of at most 104 characters that is not only periods and
spaces and holds none of `"/\:;|=,+*?<>@[]`; an empty string is absent, by the
same convention (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: a pod-level value that
breaks these rules built before and is refused now). Upstream's `validateWindowsHostProcessPod` rules are held on the assembled pod, so they
are reported at `Generate`: a container's `hostProcess` must equal the pod's
when both are set; a pod with one HostProcess container — its own
`hostProcess`, or the pod's when it sets none — must have only HostProcess
containers, init containers included; and such a pod must set
`hostNetwork: true`. `hostProcess: true` is policy-gated, see below)),
`workingDir` (a bare pass-through — `corev1.Container.WorkingDir`'s own
doc comment states only that the container runtime's default applies when
unset, and real admission enforces no path shape for it, so this schema does
not invent a stricter constraint upstream itself does not have; a
present-but-non-string value, e.g. `workingDir: 123`, is rejected rather than
silently treated as absent, in all seven kind handlers — this is a type check,
distinct from the content-validation question the previous paragraph answers),
`volumes` (the `volumes` property itself, if authored, must be an array — a
present-but-non-array value, e.g. `volumes: {name: data}`, is rejected
outright rather than silently treated as absent and building without the
requested volume/mount, the same presence-then-type-check shape as `probes`
above; each entry in that array must itself be an object — a non-object
entry, e.g. `volumes: [data]`, is rejected outright rather than silently
skipped while any well-formed sibling entries still build; every volume's
`name`, regardless of source type — `hostPath`,
`emptyDir`, `pvc`, `configMap`, `secret`, etc. — must be a valid DNS-1123
label, matching how real admission validates every `corev1.Volume.Name`; an
invalid name, e.g. containing `/`, builds successfully but is rejected at Pod
admission; two volumes sharing the same valid name are likewise rejected —
Pod volume names must be unique (`validateVolumes`' own duplicate check),
so the second entry is caught at parse time rather than only at admission;
two volumes with distinct names sharing the same `mountPath` are also
rejected — a container's own volume mounts must have unique mount paths
(`ValidateVolumeMounts`' own duplicate check), so only the first of two
colliding mounts would ever actually be reachable at admission; `readOnly`,
if authored, must be a boolean — a present-but-non-boolean value (e.g.
`readOnly: "true"`) is rejected rather than silently defaulting to a
writable mount (same fix applied to `initContainers`/`sidecars`' own
`volumeMounts` entries below, which had the identical gap);
`name` and `mountPath` are both required on every entry — the one exception
is a `pvc` entry with `volumeMode: Block`, which authors `devicePath` instead
(see "Raw block volumes" below) — a present-but-
non-string value (e.g. a numeric `mountPath`) is a type error; an entry missing
either, or authoring one with the wrong type, previously built with no
volume and no mount for that entry instead of reporting what was missing;
`emptyDir.sizeLimit`, if authored, is parsed as a
`resource.Quantity` and rejected if negative (e.g. `"-1Gi"`) — syntactically
valid but a storage quantity real Kubernetes resource validation refuses,
same as `resources`' own quantity fields above; a present-but-non-string
value (e.g. `sizeLimit: 1048576`) is rejected the same way, instead of
failing the bare type assertion silently and building an emptyDir with no
size limit at all. A zero `sizeLimit` is accepted on purpose: upstream
`validateVolumeSource` rejects only a negative value, and the kubelet applies
the limit only when it is greater than zero, so `"0"` means "no volume-level
limit" rather than an inadmissible quantity; `pvc.size` is required (the
same missing-vs-wrong-type rejection as `name`/`mountPath` above) and, once
present, must be a **positive** quantity. **Behavior-changing**
(go-kure/launcher#384): `size: "0"` used to build and is now rejected, because
`ValidatePersistentVolumeClaimSpec` runs `ValidatePositiveQuantityValue` over
`requests[storage]`, which refuses zero as well as negative values — the
claim built before was never admissible. `BuildPVC` applies the same rule,
and the `pvc` trait, which parses its claim with the `persistentvolumeclaim`
kind's `ParseClaimProperties`, refuses a zero or negative `size` too; `pvc.storageClass`,
if authored, must be a string — a present-but-non-string value (e.g. a bare
number) is rejected rather than silently building with the cluster default
class — and, once confirmed a string, a non-empty value must also be a valid
DNS-1123 subdomain, matching `ValidatePersistentVolumeClaimSpec`'s own
`ValidateClassName` check; a malformed class name (e.g. containing `_` or
`!`) previously built successfully and was rejected only at admission. An
explicitly authored `storageClass: ""` is preserved as an
opt-out request (Kubernetes distinguishes a nil `StorageClassName` — use the
cluster default — from a pointer to `""` — request no class) rather than
being collapsed to "absent" and silently provisioned through the default
class; `volumeClaimTemplates.storageClass` keeps the same distinction since
go-kure/launcher#761 (see "StatefulSet-level and claim-template properties"
below).
`pvc.accessModes`, if authored, must be a non-empty array of non-empty
strings, each one of the four real `corev1.PersistentVolumeAccessMode`
values — a present-but-non-array value (e.g. a bare string) or a non-string
element is rejected outright too, instead of silently falling through to the
`ReadWriteOnce` default while discarding the author's actual list; an
authored empty array (`accessModes: []`) is rejected outright as well —
`ValidatePersistentVolumeClaimSpec` itself requires at least one access
mode, so silently defaulting an explicit empty list to `ReadWriteOnce` would
build a claim the author never asked for rather than reporting the
malformed input; an absent `accessModes` key still defaults to
`ReadWriteOnce`, unchanged — only an authored-and-empty array is treated as
malformed; `ReadWriteOncePod`
combined with any other access mode is rejected outright — real Kubernetes
requires it be the claim's only mode; the same parser
backs `volumeClaimTemplates.accessModes` below; on `webservice` and
`worker`, the claim a `pvc` volume describes is named
`<component name>-<pod-local volume name>`, not the bare pod-local name — two
components in the same namespace that both author a `pvc` volume named
`data` would otherwise emit two colliding `PersistentVolumeClaim/data`
objects; the pod-local `Volume.Name` and its `VolumeMount` reference stay
unqualified, only the claim's name and the matching
`Volume.PersistentVolumeClaim.ClaimName` are qualified (`roleClaims` in
`role_members.go`, once, when the rule lowers the component); the join
itself escapes interior hyphens in each half (`escapeForPVCQualification`)
before concatenating, since plain `<appName>-<localName>` string
concatenation is not collision-free when either half itself contains a
hyphen — component `a-b` with volume `data`, and component `a` with volume
`b-data`, would otherwise both qualify to `a-b-data`; a qualified name over
253 characters is shortened by the one rule (`oam.ShortenNameWithSuffix`,
go-kure/launcher#793), the escaped component cut and the escaped volume kept
whole, after its characters are checked on the unshortened name, so only the
length is forgiven; `hostPath.path`
is likewise required and must be absolute — a raw host filesystem path has
no defined root to resolve a relative value against, and real admission
(`validateHostPathVolumeSource`) rejects a relative one the same way;
`configMap.configMapName` and `secret.secretName` are each required the same
way as `pvc.size`; a fully-authored entry whose `type` matches none of the
five recognized sources — including `type` omitted entirely — is rejected
outright rather than silently producing no volume or mount for an entry the
author clearly intended to add; each recognized type's own field set is
closed the same way `securityContext` and its nested objects are elsewhere
in this file — an unrecognized key on a `hostPath`, `emptyDir`, `pvc`,
`configMap`, or `secret` entry (e.g. a typo'd `sizeLmit` instead of
`sizeLimit`) is rejected rather than silently ignored, which previously let
the author's intended value take no effect with no error explaining why),
`initContainers`, `sidecars` (each entry's own `volumeMounts[].readOnly`
must be a boolean and `volumeMounts[].subPath` must be a string when
present — same presence-then-type-check shape as `volumes.readOnly` above;
`volumeMounts[].mountPath` must also be unique within that entry's own
mount list, the identical rule as `volumes`' duplicate-mountPath check
above, since each `initContainers`/`sidecars` entry is its own container;
each entry also accepts its own `securityContext`, the identical field set
and validation as the main container's own `securityContext` described
below — see that prose for the field list rather than restating it here;
each entry is a **closed key set** (go-kure/launcher#321): an
`initContainers` entry accepts `name`, `image`, `command`, `args`, `env`,
`envFrom`, `resources`, `volumeMounts`, `volumeDevices` (see "Raw block
volumes" below), `securityContext`, `workingDir` and the seven keys of
"Container fields" below,
and a `sidecars` entry those plus `ports`, `probes` and `lifecycle`, each
parsed by the same parser as the main container's field of that name. Any
other key is an error naming the entry — before that the parsers read the
keys they knew and dropped the rest, so an authored `workingDir`, `envFrom`,
`probes` or `lifecycle` built cleanly and reached no container. `probes` and
`lifecycle` on an init container are refused with their own message rather
than accepted: Kubernetes forbids both on an init container, which runs to
completion before the app containers start, and this package does not model
the restartable (`restartPolicy: Always`) init container that may carry them
— author them on a sidecar. A sidecar's probe or hook may address a port by
name only when that sidecar itself declares a `ports[]` entry of that name —
the kubelet resolves a named port against the container's own ports, so an
undeclared name would build and never resolve; unlike the main container,
whose single named port is fixed by its kind, a sidecar may declare several
and any of them is accepted. A sidecar's `ports` list is read exactly as
`deployment` reads its main container's (see "Main container ports" below):
closed entries, an IANA service `name`, a `protocol` from `TCP`/`UDP`/`SCTP`
(an empty string refused), and no repeated name or `containerPort`/`protocol`
pair within the sidecar (go-kure/launcher#660; before that the name and
protocol were taken unchecked, and a non-list `ports`, an unknown key, a
non-string name or a non-string protocol, which then read as `TCP`, was
dropped). A port name must also be unique across the
pod: the main container's ports (webservice's `http`, the `ports` list of
statefulset, daemonset and deployment) and every
sidecar's. The
API server checks names only per container and merely warns across them,
while a Service selecting the name reaches only the first container that
declares it, so a repeated name is refused, naming both containers. Init
containers declare no ports, so they take no part. Closing the entry is behavior-changing under an
unchanged `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`: a document that authored any other
key on an entry built before and errors now. It is taken on the same
reasoning as the `volumeClaimTemplates` entry below — the key never reached
the output its author intended — and is signalled by the `format` commit
scope),
and `affinity` (four keys, parsed by `parseAffinity`: `enablePodAntiAffinity`
(boolean), `topologyKey` (string, default `kubernetes.io/hostname`),
`podAntiAffinityType` (string, `preferred`|`required`, default `preferred`)
and `nodeSelector` (a string→string map). Pod anti-affinity is emitted only on
an explicit `enablePodAntiAffinity: true`; authoring the block without it just
supplies the two defaults above, and omitting the block entirely leaves
`topologyKey`/`podAntiAffinityType` empty rather than defaulted (the defaults
are applied by `parseAffinity` only once the block is present, unlike the
`postgresql` component, which also tracks whether the block was authored at all).
The key set is closed (go-kure/launcher#790). The shorthand is not a
Kubernetes `Affinity`: `nodeAffinity`, `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity`
under it are each refused with what the shorthand has for the field and where
an affinity in the Kubernetes shape is authored (`deployment`, `statefulset`,
`daemonset`, `job`, `cronjob`), and any other key is refused as
`affinity: unrecognized key "<key>"`, each whatever its value. The parser read
none of them before, so a caller that skips the document check had them
dropped; see
[Upstream fields a hand-parsed kind does not read](#upstream-fields-a-hand-parsed-kind-does-not-read).
Each of the four sub-fields is read with a presence-reporting helper, so a
sub-field authored with the wrong type is **rejected by name**
(`affinity.topologyKey: must be a string, got float64`) rather than
discarded while the default above is emitted as though the key had never
been written, and a non-string `nodeSelector` **value** is refused by key
(`affinity.nodeSelector["rack"]: must be a string, got int`), the
alphabetically first offending key when several are wrong. A null sub-field
is absence and takes the default an omitted one takes, and a null
`nodeSelector` value is absence too: `nodeSelector: {zone: a, rack: null}`
builds the selector `{zone: a}` (before go-kure/launcher#466 it was refused
as `must be a string, got <nil>`). `podAntiAffinityType`
must be `preferred` or `required`: a well-formed string outside the enum is
refused by name, and an explicitly authored `podAntiAffinityType: ""` is an
error rather than a fall back to `preferred` — the empty string reaches the
enum check instead of being read as an absent key. An authored
`topologyKey: ""`, by contrast, *does* fall back to the default. This is the
same contract the `postgresql` component's own affinity block has
(go-kure/launcher#448). **Behavior-changing** under
`launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1` (go-kure/launcher#452) for one authored shape:
the published schema leaves `nodeSelector` values untyped, so a document
with a non-string value (`rack: 3`) passed schema validation, built with that
entry dropped, and is now rejected. A wrongly typed sub-field itself was
already refused by schema validation for an authored document; the parser's
own check now covers a caller that hands properties to a handler without it,
which previously got the default. The out-of-enum error now reads
`affinity.podAntiAffinityType: invalid value …` rather than
`invalid podAntiAffinityType …`).
On `worker`, the affinity the shorthand evaluates to is also validated the way the
`deployment` component validates a raw `affinity`, so a `topologyKey`, or a
`nodeSelector` key or value, that is not valid label syntax is refused
(`affinity: the shorthand evaluates to an affinity the API server would
refuse: …`). **Behavior-changing** under `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`: such
a worker document built before, into a manifest the API server rejects, and
is now refused at build time — a pre-GA format change (`docs/oam/design-gvk.md`
§ Document-Format Lifecycle), signalled by the `fix(format)` commit scope. The
check runs after every other worker property is parsed, so an earlier refusal
keeps its place. A component name longer than 63 characters stays refused;
when the shorthand enables pod anti-affinity, whose label selector carries
the name, this check now refuses it before the container-name check does.
`webservice` validates the evaluated shorthand the same way, with the same
message, as the last step of its parse, as a pre-GA format change too
(a `fix(format)` change of its own): such a webservice document also built
before, into a Deployment the API server rejects. A webservice's name is
checked against the Service-name rule first, so an over-long name is refused
there, before this check.

### Container fields

Seven `corev1.Container` fields are read on every container of a hand-parsed
workload kind (go-kure/launcher#790): as top-level keys for the main container
of `deployment`, `statefulset`, `daemonset`, `job` and `cronjob` — and of
`webservice` and `worker`, which forward them to their `deployment` member — and
as keys of each `initContainers` and `sidecars` entry. One parser
(`parseContainerFields`, `container_fields.go`) and one schema fragment
(`schemaContainerFields`) serve the three positions, pinned to each other by
`TestContainerFieldsSchemaMatchesParser`.

| Property | Type | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `imagePullPolicy` | string: `Always`, `IfNotPresent`, `Never` | `imagePullPolicy` of the container. |
| `terminationMessagePath` | string | `terminationMessagePath`, passed through: upstream validates no path shape for it, so none is invented here. |
| `terminationMessagePolicy` | string: `File`, `FallbackToLogsOnError` | `terminationMessagePolicy`. |
| `stdin`, `stdinOnce`, `tty` | boolean | The field of that name. Upstream has no rule relating the three, so none is applied. |
| `resizePolicy` | list of `{resourceName, restartPolicy}` | `resizePolicy`. Both keys are required; `resourceName` is `cpu` or `memory`, `restartPolicy` is `NotRequired` or `RestartContainer`; a resource is named once. |

- **Nothing is defaulted.** A field that is not authored is not emitted, which
  leaves the API server's own defaults in force (for `imagePullPolicy` see
  [Every spec field is this package's to write](#every-spec-field-is-this-packages-to-write)).
  An authored `false` on a boolean is the field's zero value and renders as
  absent too.
- **No policy check.** `imagePullPolicy: Never` and `IfNotPresent` are accepted
  with no capability gate and no `Policy` method: a platform that requires
  `Always` has to enforce it at admission.
- An explicit null is absence (see [The null contract](#the-null-contract)), and
  so is an empty string on `terminationMessagePath` (`parseStringField`'s
  convention) and an empty `resizePolicy` list. An empty string on
  `imagePullPolicy` or `terminationMessagePolicy` is refused, as any value
  outside the enum is: by property validation in a document, and by the parser
  with the message below. The enum values are case-sensitive, as upstream:
  `imagePullPolicy: always` is refused with
  `imagePullPolicy: invalid value "always", must be one of Always, IfNotPresent, Never`.
- The `resizePolicy` rules are upstream's (`validateResizePolicy`,
  `validateInitContainers` in `k8s.io/kubernetes`
  `pkg/apis/core/validation/validation.go`), checked at build time so the author
  gets the entry named instead of an admission error:
  - an unknown key, a missing key, a resource other than `cpu`/`memory`, an
    unknown restart policy and a repeated resource are each refused by entry
    (`resizePolicy[1].resourceName: "cpu" is named by an earlier entry; …`);
  - `RestartContainer` is refused on an `initContainers` entry: Kubernetes
    allows it only on a restartable init container, which this package does not
    model. `NotRequired` is accepted there;
  - on a pod whose `restartPolicy` is `Never` — which only `job` and `cronjob`
    can author — every container's restart policy must be `NotRequired`. That
    check runs on the assembled pod spec (`checkResizePolicyRestart`), so it is
    reported at `Generate`, not at `ToApplicationConfig`.
- On an `initContainers` or `sidecars` entry every message carries the entry
  label first (`sidecars[0] "proxy": tty: must be a boolean, got string`).

An `initContainers` entry also reads its own `restartPolicy` and
`restartPolicyRules` (go-kure/launcher#790), held to upstream's
`validateInitContainerRestartPolicy` and `validateContainerRestartPolicy`:

- `restartPolicy` is `Never` or `OnFailure`, overriding the pod's restart
  policy for that container. `Always` is refused with its reason: it makes the
  init container restartable (a native sidecar), which this package does not
  model, the same reason `probes` and `lifecycle` are refused on an init entry;
  author a `sidecars` entry instead;
- `restartPolicyRules` needs `restartPolicy` and holds at most 20 rules. A rule
  is a closed object: `action` is required and is `Restart` (upstream's
  `RestartAllContainers` needs a separate feature gate, and is refused), and
  `exitCodes` is required: a closed object whose `operator` is required and is
  `In` or `NotIn`, and whose optional `values` is a list of at most 255 int32
  exit codes, each once (the field is a set);
- Kubernetes keeps either field on an init container only with the
  `ContainerRestartRules` feature gate, on by default from Kubernetes 1.35. A
  cluster with the gate off drops both fields when it creates the pod, without
  an error, so the init container falls back to the pod's restart policy. This
  package does not see the target cluster's version, so that is a documented
  limit, not a check.

On a `sidecars` entry neither key is read, and both are refused as unknown
keys. At the top level neither is a container key either.
`restartPolicyRules` is refused there on every workload kind, with the reason
that upstream accepts a container's rules only together with the container's
own `restartPolicy`. `restartPolicy` there is the *pod's* restart policy: a
key of `job` and `cronjob`, where the main container's own `restartPolicy`
therefore has no name to be authored or refused under, and refused with its
reason on the other kinds, whose pod template apps/v1 validation holds to
`Always`. See
[Upstream fields a hand-parsed kind does not read](#upstream-fields-a-hand-parsed-kind-does-not-read)
for these and for the container fields read under another name (`name`, the
three probe fields, `volumeMounts`, `volumeDevices`).

### Referencing an existing claim (`pvc.claimName`)

A `pvc` volume with `claimName` mounts an existing claim instead of generating
one (go-kure/launcher#702). The claim usually comes from a
`persistentvolumeclaim` component or a `pvc` trait, but it can be any claim in
the namespace. The volume generates no object, and its claim name is used
exactly as written: it is not qualified with the component name the way a
role kind's claim is.

**On the five pod kinds `claimName` is required.** `deployment`,
`statefulset`, `daemonset`, `job` and `cronjob` generate no claim, so a `pvc`
volume without `claimName` is refused (`volume "data": a pvc volume must set
claimName to an existing claim; the component generates none, so declare it
with a persistentvolumeclaim component or a pvc trait`). This is a breaking
pre-GA format change. To migrate, declare the claim with a
`persistentvolumeclaim` component (or a `pvc` trait) carrying the volume's
`size`, its `storageClass` as `storageClassName`, and its `accessModes` and
`volumeMode`. Then reference it from the volume with `claimName`. Keep
`accessModes` on the volume, and keep `volumeMode: Block` there too: a
`devicePath` mount needs it on the volume. The environment's storage-size
limit and default now apply to that claim, not to the volume.

`webservice` and `worker` still accept a `pvc` volume that describes its
claim. The rule turns each one into a synthesized `pvc` trait on its
`deployment` member, named `<component>-<volume>` as before, and rewrites the
volume to reference it by `claimName`. The output is unchanged. The volume's
`claimObjectName` names that claim instead (go-kure/launcher#787, role
`workload-volume-claim`; see "`deploymentObjectName`, `serviceObjectName` and
`serviceAccountObjectName`" below).

Such a volume that leaves `storageClass` unauthored (absent or `null`) takes
the ClusterProfile `pvc` capability's `storageClassName`, as an authored `pvc`
trait and the `persistentvolumeclaim` kind do (go-kure/launcher#746). The
synthesized trait is sealed, so the engine merges no rendering into it; the
rule reads the binding through `LoweringContext.Capability`, which records
`pvc` in `ConsumedCapabilities`, and fills the value itself. An authored
class, `""` included, wins. **Pre-GA output change**: such a volume used to
ignore the binding, so an existing claim built from it got the cluster's
default class when it was created, if the cluster had one. A claim's
assigned `storageClassName` cannot change: if the binding's class differs
from it, the claim fails to apply until it is recreated or the volume
authors the assigned class. A claim created with no class may take one
later, so it applies. A `statefulset` `volumeClaimTemplates` entry takes the
same default (go-kure/launcher#761; see "StatefulSet-level and claim-template
properties").

- `claimName` must be a DNS-1123 subdomain.
- `size` and `storageClass` are refused alongside it, because the referenced
  claim states its own (`volume "data": size cannot be set with claimName; …`).
- `claimName: ""` is refused, not read as absent.
- `claimObjectName` is refused alongside it: it names the claim a
  `webservice` or `worker` volume generates, and this volume generates none.
- `accessModes` stays: it states the referenced claim's modes, defaulting to
  `ReadWriteOnce` as on a claim a role kind describes. The workload still reads them. A
  non-RWX claim still forces `strategy: Recreate` on a Deployment, still
  refuses `replicas` above 1, and still limits a `scaler` to one replica. To
  scale against a `ReadWriteMany` claim, state `accessModes: [ReadWriteMany]`
  on the volume.
- `volumeMode`, `readOnly` and the mount keys work as on a described claim.

Every workload kind that accepts `volumes` accepts `claimName`. `BuildPVC`
refuses a `PVCConfig` that carries a `ClaimName`: there is no object to build.

### Raw block volumes (`volumeMode: Block`)

A claim with `volumeMode: Block` has no filesystem. A container consumes it
through `volumeDevices` at a `devicePath`, never through `volumeMounts`
(go-kure/launcher#385). The claim and the pod template are validated as
separate objects, so the apiserver accepts a Block claim paired with a
filesystem mount and the pods then fail at kubelet mount time; every rule
below reports that mismatch at build time instead. The rules are the same on
all seven kinds (`webservice`, `worker`, `deployment`, `statefulset`,
`daemonset`, `job`, `cronjob`), because they live in the shared parsers.

- **`volumes[]` pvc entry.** Adds `volumeMode` (`Filesystem`|`Block`) and
  `devicePath`. The entry takes exactly one of `mountPath` and `devicePath`,
  and `devicePath` is authored if and only if `volumeMode: Block` is — in both
  directions, with nothing inferred: `mountPath` with `Block`, `devicePath`
  with `Filesystem` or with no mode, and both paths at once are each an error.
  A Block entry reaches the main container as a `corev1.VolumeDevice` and has
  no `volumeMount`. The claim carries the authored mode; an unauthored mode
  stays unset (the apiserver defaults it to `Filesystem`), so an existing
  document's claim is byte-identical. `devicePath` on any other volume type is
  an error.
- **`volumeClaimTemplates[]` entry (`statefulset`).** The same exactly-one
  rule with `devicePath`, and `volumeMode: Block` is now accepted (it was
  rejected before). A Block template renders a claim template with
  `volumeMode: Block` and a main-container `volumeDevices` entry.
- **The published schema says "exactly one of".** A `volumes[]` entry and a
  `volumeClaimTemplates[]` entry publish `mountPath` and `devicePath` as two
  optional keys plus a required `exclusive` group of the two
  (go-kure/launcher#790), so a validator built from the schema refuses both
  and neither, as the build does. A key counts as authored when it is present
  and not null, an empty string included: `mountPath: ""` beside a
  `devicePath` is both, through the transform and through a direct handler
  call alike.
- **`initContainers[]` / `sidecars[]` entry.** Adds `volumeDevices:
  [{name, devicePath}]`, a closed key set with both keys required. A
  `volumeDevices` name must be a Block volume this component declares (a
  `volumes` pvc entry or a claim template); a `volumeMounts` name must **not**
  be one. A `volumeMounts` name the component does not declare at all stays
  accepted, because the `configmap` and `external-secret` traits add their
  volumes after the component is generated — and neither adds a Block volume.
- **Name and path rules** mirror `ValidateVolumeDevices`, per container: a
  volume is named at most once in `volumeDevices` and not in both
  `volumeMounts` and `volumeDevices`; a `devicePath` is unique, contains no
  `..` element, and is not also a `mountPath`. On `statefulset` this spans the
  claim templates and `volumes` together, so a Block claim template cannot
  share its name with a `volumes` entry or another claim template. The
  `configmap` and `external-secret` traits likewise refuse a volume name the
  main container already attaches as a device — including a Block claim
  template, which has no pod volume of its own — and a mount at a path it
  already uses as a `devicePath`.

**Compatibility.** Additive: every new rejection concerns a Block volume,
and no document could declare one before (a `volumes` pvc entry had no
`volumeMode`, and a claim template's `Block` was rejected). The one new rule
that reads existing keys — a `volumeMounts` entry naming a Block volume is an
error — can therefore only fire on a document that uses the new surface. The
published schemas drop `Required` from `mountPath` on `volumes` items and
claim templates; the parsers still require one of the two paths.

### Pod-level properties

The seven kind components also share one pod-level property surface
(go-kure/launcher#342, ADR-036 L1), parsed by `parsePodSpec` (`podspec.go`)
straight into a `corev1.PodSpec` and rendered by the shared `buildPodSpec`,
which every kind assigns to its pod template. Property names are the
`corev1.PodSpec` JSON names, except three that carry a `pod` prefix because
the bare name is already a property at some kind: `podSecurityContext`
(container `securityContext` exists everywhere), `podResources` (container
`resources`), and `podActiveDeadlineSeconds` (cronjob's job-level
`activeDeadlineSeconds`). Each accepted value is validated the way real
admission validates it when that check is deterministic from the document
alone (DNS-1123 names, enums, IP literals, duplicate names, the cross-field
exclusions listed below, and the `os.name` contract: a `windows` pod may not
set the Linux-only pod and container fields, a `linux` pod may not set
`windowsOptions`); checks needing cluster state (host ports under
`hostNetwork`, feature gates, RuntimeClass existence) are left to the cluster.

| Property | Type | Effect | Kind |
|----------|------|--------|------|
| `serviceAccountName` | string | **Behavior-changing.** Pods run as the named account; on `webservice` and `worker` the per-component ServiceAccount is *not* generated. The `rbac` trait binds its Role/ClusterRole to this account via `oam.ServiceAccountNamer` (see below). Unset on a pod kind, the pod names no account (the namespace's `default`), and the kind sets the pod-level `automountServiceAccountToken: false` unless that is authored (go-kure/launcher#702); a role kind's generated account carries `automountServiceAccountToken: false` itself. An authored account is owned elsewhere and its own setting governs, so authors who want the pod not to mount a token set the pod-level `automountServiceAccountToken: false` explicitly — the handler does not inject it. | additive when unset |
| `automountServiceAccountToken` | bool | Pod-level token automount override. | additive |
| `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | int ≥ 0 | Grace period before SIGKILL. | additive |
| `podActiveDeadlineSeconds` | int 1..MaxInt32 | Pod-level `activeDeadlineSeconds`. **cronjob and job only** — apps/v1 rejects it on Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet templates, so the other kinds neither publish nor accept it, and refuse the upstream name `activeDeadlineSeconds` with that reason (on `job` and `cronjob` that name is the JobSpec's). Distinct from the JobSpec-level `activeDeadlineSeconds` below: this one bounds a single pod, that one the whole job. | additive |
| `dnsPolicy`, `dnsConfig` | enum, object | `ClusterFirstWithHostNet`/`ClusterFirst`/`Default`/`None`; `dnsConfig` = `nameservers` (≤3 plain IPv4/IPv6 literals — a zone-scoped address such as `fe80::1%eth0` is rejected, matching upstream's `net.ParseIP`-based check, which has no notion of a zone), `searches` (≤32 entries whose joined length, separators included, is ≤2048 characters — the `resolv.conf` search-line limit, so 32 individually valid domains can still be refused), `options[]{name,value}`. `None` requires at least one nameserver. | additive |
| `nodeSelector`, `nodeName`, `schedulerName`, `priorityClassName`, `preemptionPolicy`, `runtimeClassName`, `schedulingGates[]{name}`, `schedulingGroup{podGroupName}` | scheduling | Placement fields; gate names must be unique. `nodeName` is a DNS-1123 subdomain (a Node is an ordinary object, so an invalid value is refused at admission, not merely unmatched). `schedulerName` is deliberately *not* validated: upstream constrains its form nowhere, so an arbitrary string is a legal document and rejecting one here would refuse work a cluster accepts. | additive |
| `hostNetwork`, `hostPID`, `hostIPC` | bool | Host namespaces. **Policy-gated**: rejected by `ApplyPolicy` unless `AllowHostNetwork()`/`AllowHostPID()`/`AllowHostIPC()` allow them (`enforce.go`'s `enforceHostNamespaces`, called from all seven kinds; `NoopPolicy` denies all three). | additive |
| `shareProcessNamespace` | bool | Mutually exclusive with `hostPID: true`. | additive |
| `hostname`, `subdomain`, `setHostnameAsFQDN`, `hostnameOverride`, `hostAliases[]{ip,hostnames}` | naming | `hostname`/`subdomain` are DNS-1123 labels; `hostnameOverride` is a ≤64-char subdomain and cannot combine with `hostNetwork` or `setHostnameAsFQDN`. `hostAliases[].ip` is a plain IPv4/IPv6 literal, zone suffixes rejected as for `dnsConfig.nameservers`. | additive |
| `podSecurityContext` | object | The full `corev1.PodSecurityContext` field set (`runAsUser`/`runAsGroup`/`runAsNonRoot`/`fsGroup`/`fsGroupChangePolicy`/`supplementalGroups`/`supplementalGroupsPolicy`/`sysctls`/`seLinuxOptions`/`seLinuxChangePolicy`/`seccompProfile`/`appArmorProfile`/`windowsOptions`), closed and validated like the container `securityContext`; the `windowsOptions` strings are held to upstream's rules as on a container (see "Container fields"). `sysctls[].name` must match the sysctl grammar (≤253 characters of dot- or slash-separated lowercase alphanumeric segments) and be unique within the list. `windowsOptions.hostProcess: true` additionally requires `hostNetwork: true`, which upstream demands of any pod containing HostProcess containers. The `runAsUser: 0` / `runAsNonRoot: true` contradiction is judged per container on the *effective* values once the containers are assembled, not on this object alone — a container-level `runAsUser` overrides the pod-level one, so the pair is a valid document when every container names a non-root UID, and the deferred check also catches a container-level `runAsUser: 0` under a pod-level `runAsNonRoot`. **Partly policy-gated**: `windowsOptions.hostProcess: true` is rejected unless `AllowPrivileged()` allows it (a HostProcess pod runs with the node's own privileges, and upstream forces every container in it to be HostProcess too); every other field has no policy hook. | additive |
| `imagePullSecrets[]{name}`, `enableServiceLinks`, `os{name}`, `hostUsers`, `readinessGates[]{conditionType}`, `resourceClaims[]{name, resourceClaimName \| resourceClaimTemplateName}`, `podResources{requests,limits}` | misc | `podResources` accepts only `cpu`, `memory` and `hugepages-<size>` (pod-level resources have no ephemeral-storage or extended resources), and a `hugepages-<size>` entry needs `cpu` or `memory` in `requests` or `limits` (admission's "HugePages require cpu or memory"; pod-level resources get no defaults); claim names must be unique and name exactly one source (an empty name beside the other counts as a second; the schema publishes the pair as an `exclusive` group, go-kure/launcher#790). `hostUsers: false` cannot combine with `hostPID` or `hostIPC` (upstream forbids both outright); it stays authorable alongside `hostNetwork`, which upstream forbids only on a cluster without user-namespace host-network support, so whether that pair is accepted is a property of the target cluster rather than of the document. **`podResources` is policy-gated**: its cpu and memory requests and limits are checked against `MaxCPU()`/`MaxMemory()`, the same budget the container `resources` are checked against. | additive |

Deliberately **not** accepted — each is rejected with an error naming the
reason rather than silently ignored: `ephemeralContainers` (added to a running
pod through its `ephemeralcontainers` subresource, never on a template),
`priority` and `overhead` (the Priority and RuntimeClass admission
controllers, on by default, derive them from
`priorityClassName`/`runtimeClassName` and reject a pod whose authored value
differs, so authoring one can at best repeat the derived value),
`serviceAccount` (deprecated alias of `serviceAccountName`),
`evictionResponders` (alpha upstream, behind the `EvictionRequestAPI` feature
gate) and `containers` (the pod's one main container is the component's own
container properties, and further ones are `sidecars` entries where the kind
has them).

Every pod kind config implements `oam.ServiceAccountNamer` (`pkg/oam/handler.go`),
returning `(name, runsPods)`: the authored `serviceAccountName` (or `""`) and
`true`. A role rule hands its `deployment` member the name of the account its
`serviceaccount` member generates (the component name, or the one
`serviceAccountObjectName` or the `Naming` hook gave that object) unless
`serviceAccountName` is authored, so a `webservice` or `worker` answers the
account it generates. The `rbac` trait
(`pkg/oam/builtin/traits/rbac.go`) binds its RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding
subject to that name, so binding follows the account the pods run as; the Role
and binding objects keep their component-derived names. A pod-running
component with no account name is refused by `rbac` rather than bound to an
account that does not exist; see the traits README.

The pod's `serviceAccountName` is the namer's own answer, so the account a
RoleBinding names and the account the pods run as are one value by
construction. The shared kind test asserts they agree on every kind, including
against a deliberately mismatched Application name, and that a role kind's
generated ServiceAccount carries the same name.

`securityContext.privileged: true` is rejected unless the environment policy's
`AllowPrivileged()` allows it (`enforce.go`'s `enforcePrivileged`).
`securityContext.capabilities.add` is separately enforced against
`AllowedContainerCapabilities()`/`ForbiddenContainerCapabilities()` (see above,
`enforce.go`'s `enforceContainerCapabilities`). `enforcePrivileged` gates a
second field besides `privileged`: `securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess`
is rejected under the same `AllowPrivileged()`, on any container that authors
it (go-kure/launcher#790 made the container `windowsOptions` authorable).
Those three fields are the whole container-level policy surface:
`enforcePrivileged` and `enforceContainerCapabilities` are the only enforcers
taking a `*corev1.SecurityContext`, and every policy call outside `enforce.go`
that touches a container `securityContext` is a call site of one of them. The
package has other enforcers reached from the same `ApplyPolicy` bodies — the
pod-level pair described below, plus `enforceHostNamespaces`,
`enforceHostPathVolumes`, the `enforceMax*` family and
`enforceAllowedRegistries`/`enforceAllowedURLHosts` — but none of them reads a
container `securityContext`. Both checks cover the main container and
every `initContainers`/`sidecars` entry (go-kure/launcher#312's shared
`enforceExtraContainer` helper), not just the main container.

The pod-level `podSecurityContext` has a **separate** hook —
`enforcePodHostProcess` (`enforce.go`) rejects
`podSecurityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess` under `AllowPrivileged()`. It is
a different object, not an exception to the container-level list above:
`PodSpecConfig` embeds `corev1.PodSpec`, so its `SecurityContext` is a
`*corev1.PodSecurityContext`, which `enforcePrivileged` never sees. Both
spellings are authorable — see the `podSecurityContext` row under "Pod-level
properties".

The pod-level surface carries two policy checks of its own, both called from
all seven kinds' `ApplyPolicy` next to `enforceHostNamespaces`:
`enforcePodResources` measures `podResources`' cpu and memory requests and
limits against `MaxCPU()`/`MaxMemory()` — without it an author could keep the
container under the maximum and put the oversized request on the pod, which
the scheduler charges against the node identically — and
`enforcePodHostProcess` rejects `podSecurityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess:
true` unless `AllowPrivileged()` allows it, the Windows spelling of
`securityContext.privileged` (`enforcePrivileged` checks the container-level
`windowsOptions.hostProcess` too, so the two spellings share one switch). An
unset `MaxCPU`/`MaxMemory` leaves pod-level resources unconstrained: pod-level
resources are written only when authored, so there is no generated default to
fall back on.

A `volumes` entry sourced from `hostPath` is rejected unless the environment
policy's `AllowHostPathVolumes()` allows it (`enforce.go`'s
`enforceHostPathVolumes`, the same reused-mechanism shape as
`enforcePrivileged` above); like `enforcePrivileged`, it is called from all
seven kind components' `ApplyPolicy`, not just one — a hostPath volume mounts
an arbitrary path from the node's own filesystem into the Pod, so an
unenforced policy denial here is a container-escape-adjacent gap, not merely
a style one. The same switch gates a PersistentVolume's `hostPath` and `local`
sources, on every path that produces the object (see **persistentvolume**
below): both name a path on the node, which a pod reaches by binding the
volume through a claim.

Setting any `securityContext` field makes the container's `SecurityContext`
non-nil, which opts it out of the `security-context` trait's nil-only
backfill for every *other* `SecurityContext` field too. If a component uses
both, the trait's `Generate()` pass runs later and unconditionally overwrites
`container.SecurityContext` — the trait always wins when both are applied to
the same component. This applies to a component-authored `initContainers`/
`sidecars` entry's own `securityContext` too, not just the main container's:
the trait's `applyToPodSpec` (`pkg/oam/builtin/traits/security_context.go`)
overwrites `SecurityContext` on every entry of both `podSpec.Containers`
(which includes rendered sidecars) and `podSpec.InitContainers`, so it wins
over an init container's or sidecar's own authored value the same way it
wins over the main container's. Use the trait for a safe, complete
PSA-consistent default; use this property for raw, partial, full-fidelity
authoring.

`env`, `envFrom`, `resources`, `lifecycle`, `securityContext`, `workingDir`, and
`probes` are each schema fragments parameterized by a `reserved bool` (mirroring
`pkg/oam/builtin/traits/schema.go`'s `schemaNetworkPolicy(reserved bool)`):
every built-in call site passes `false` today. Deciding which of these fields
should be platform-reserved (rejecting any authored value via
`PropertySchema.PlatformReserved`/`enforcePlatformReserved`) is a consumer-side
policy choice, not something this shared schema hardcodes.

### Deployment-level properties (`deployment`, `webservice`, `worker`)

Three components produce an `appsv1.Deployment`: the kind-named `deployment`
(go-kure/launcher#343; ADR-036 L1, the stratified-levels decision: one
PodSpec/Container projection shared by every kind, with kind-named components
projecting their own API kind), and the two role-named kinds `webservice`
(Deployment + Service) and `worker` (Deployment, no Service). Everything above
— the container-level surface and the pod-level surface — applies to all three
unchanged, and so does the rest of `DeploymentSpec` below: it is parsed by
`parseDeploymentSpec` (`deployment_spec.go`) into real `appsv1` types and
written by its `apply` onto the built object, from one fragment all three
handlers compose (go-kure/launcher#341).

Sharing the fragment is the point rather than a convenience. These fields are
properties of the API kind, not of the role a component plays, so a document
that moves a workload from `webservice` to `deployment` — or the reverse —
should not lose a `strategy` on the way. Every rule the table below states,
including the refusals, therefore holds identically on all three.

The three kinds are still not layered, and one is not a superset of the others.
`deployment` deliberately publishes **no `port`** (and so emits no Service),
**no `affinity` shorthand** and **no default topology-spread constraint** —
none of those is a `DeploymentSpec` field, and a kind named after the API kind
should project the API kind rather than launcher's opinions about it. A
workload that wants launcher to create its Service uses `webservice`. This is
the reversible direction: adding a property later is additive, removing one is
breaking. Its `ports` list (below) is that kind of addition: container ports
are a `PodSpec` field, and declaring them emits no Service.

What `deployment` *does* publish, and the role kinds do not, is the raw
`corev1` form of the same three scheduling concerns — see "Raw scheduling
properties" immediately below. The two are not alternatives: the shorthand is
an opinion, the raw shapes are the API.

The default topology-spread opinion is still available on `deployment`, as an
explicit opt-in rather than a kind default: the `topology-spread` trait (see
the trait handlers README) applies the same
`BuildTopologySpreadConstraints` the role kinds use, exported for that reason,
from the Deployment's post-policy replica count. It refuses a Deployment that
already carries raw `topologySpreadConstraints`, so the two never merge.

#### Main container ports

`deployment` publishes `ports`, the main container's `corev1.ContainerPort` list
(go-kure/launcher#280). It declares container ports only: the kind still emits
no Service (use `webservice`, or a `service` component, for one).

`daemonset`, `statefulset`, `job` and `cronjob` publish the same `ports`, with
the same entry rules (go-kure/launcher#334): container ports are a PodSpec
field, so every kind-named workload component projects them. `ports` emits no
Service on any of them. A named probe or hook port resolves against the
main container's `ports`; with none declared, it is refused.

**Breaking (go-kure/launcher#690): `daemonset` and `statefulset` dropped `port`
and the Service it drove**, as `deployment` did in go-kure/launcher#343. `port`
declared the main container's first port and a Service in front of it: a
ClusterIP Service named after the component on `daemonset`, a headless one
named `serviceName` (default: the component name) on `statefulset`. An authored
`port` is now refused as an unknown property. To migrate:

- Move the number into `ports` under the name `port` gave it, so named probe
  and hook ports keep resolving: `port: N` becomes
  `ports: [{name: http, containerPort: N}]` on `daemonset`,
  `ports: [{name: tcp, containerPort: N}]` on `statefulset`.
- Author the Service as a `service` component that selects the pods
  (`selector: {app: <component>}`). For a `statefulset`'s governing Service,
  set `clusterIP: None` and name it in `serviceName`.
- `serviceName` no longer defaults to the component name: unset, the
  StatefulSet carries `serviceName: ""`. The API server refuses a change to
  `spec.serviceName` on an existing StatefulSet, so one that relied on the
  default and now names the authored Service must be recreated: delete it with
  `--cascade=orphan` so its pods survive, then apply. The adopted pods keep the
  old `spec.subdomain`, which is set only when a pod is created, so their DNS
  names under the new Service do not resolve until they are replaced: run
  `kubectl rollout restart statefulset/<name>` (or, under `updateStrategy:
  OnDelete`, delete the pods one at a time). A `rollingUpdate.partition`
  excludes the pods below it from the restart: set it to `0` for the restart,
  or delete those pods one at a time. (The authored Service
  cannot keep the old name: it is the component's own, and component names are
  unique within an Application.)
- A trait that routed to the component's own Service (an implicit `ingress`,
  `httproute` or `expose` backend, or a `networkPolicy` ingress allow) now
  belongs on the authored `service`; on the workload it is refused with
  `component "<name>" has no service port`.

`examples/13-statefulset.yaml` shows the result.

| property | type | notes | compat |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ports` | array | Each entry is `containerPort` (required, 1–65535), `name` (an IANA service name, as the API server checks a container port name) and `protocol` (`TCP`/`UDP`/`SCTP`, default `TCP`; an empty string is refused, as the published enum refuses it); any other key, `hostPort` and `hostIP` included, is refused. Names must be unique, as the API server requires, and also unique across the pod: a sidecar port of the same name is refused (go-kure/launcher#660). A repeated `containerPort`/`protocol` pair is refused too, which the API server only warns about: the second entry declares nothing new. The same number on two protocols is two ports. An absent, null or empty list declares no ports. A probe or lifecycle hook may address a declared port by name; a name the main container does not declare is refused, since the kubelet resolves it only against that container's own ports. Without `ports`, a named probe or hook port is refused. | additive (`daemonset`/`statefulset`: replaces `port`, go-kure/launcher#690) |

#### Raw scheduling properties

`deployment` publishes `affinity`, `tolerations` and
`topologySpreadConstraints` as their plain `corev1` shapes
(go-kure/launcher#412), parsed by `scheduling.go`. Nothing is inferred from the
component: every selector, weight and topology key is authored.

The other kind-named workloads publish the same shapes through the same parsers
and schemas, so every rule in the table below holds wherever the key is
published (go-kure/launcher#790):

| kind | `affinity` | `tolerations` | `topologySpreadConstraints` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deployment` | raw | yes | yes |
| `statefulset` | raw | yes | yes |
| `daemonset` | raw | yes | yes |
| `job` | raw | yes | yes |
| `cronjob` | raw | yes | yes |

**Breaking (go-kure/launcher#790): `statefulset` dropped the four-key `affinity`
shorthand.** Its `affinity` is the raw `corev1` shape, as on the other kinds in
this table, so `enablePodAntiAffinity`, `topologyKey`, `podAntiAffinityType` and
`nodeSelector` under it are refused as unrecognized keys. To migrate, author
what the shorthand built: a `podAntiAffinity` term selecting `app: <component>`
(see [The `app` label](#the-app-label)) over the topology key, `preferred` with
weight 100 or `required`; and, for `nodeSelector`, a required `nodeAffinity`
with one `In` requirement per label.

- Nothing is defaulted on any of them: an unauthored key emits nothing, and a
  constraint or an affinity term selects only the pods its authored
  `labelSelector` names. The pods a kind builds carry `app: <component>` (see
  [The `app` label](#the-app-label)).
- **No policy check.** `tolerations` is accepted with no capability gate and no
  `Policy` method on every kind that publishes it, so a component can tolerate
  any taint, a control-plane node's included; a platform that reserves nodes
  by taint has to enforce that at admission.
- The `topology-spread` trait stays Deployment-only. It is refused on a
  `statefulset`, a `daemonset`, a `job` and a `cronjob`, with or without
  authored constraints (`component "<name>" generates no Deployment the trait
  can act on`).
- On a `cronjob` the three keys are written onto the pod template of the Job
  template (`spec.jobTemplate.spec.template.spec`), so they apply to the pods of
  every Job the CronJob creates.
- On a `daemonset` the three keys reach the DaemonSet's pod template as
  authored. The DaemonSet controller creates one pod for each node the
  template's node affinity, node selector and tolerations admit, and pins the
  pod to that node; a pod affinity term or a `DoNotSchedule` spread constraint
  the node cannot satisfy leaves that pod pending instead of placing it
  elsewhere. Nothing here checks for that.

| property | type | notes | compat |
|---|---|---|---|
| `affinity` | object | `nodeAffinity`, `podAffinity`, `podAntiAffinity`, each with the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` / `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` arms. Node requirement operators are `In`/`NotIn`/`Exists`/`DoesNotExist`/`Gt`/`Lt`, with upstream's arity rule — `In`/`NotIn` need at least one value, `Exists`/`DoesNotExist` none, `Gt`/`Lt` exactly one integer. `matchExpressions` keys are node label keys (qualified names). `matchFields` keys are *not* qualified names and are not free-form field paths either: `metadata.name` is the only key Kubernetes accepts, and a field requirement takes only `In` or `NotIn` with exactly one value — the arity rule above belongs to `matchExpressions`, and a `matchFields` entry it would accept can still be refused at admission. That single value is a node name and is validated as a DNS-1123 subdomain: the key resolving is what *arms* the value rule upstream rather than ending it, so a well-formed key and operator with a malformed value is still refused. `matchFields` therefore publishes its own item schema rather than sharing `matchExpressions`', with `key` and `operator` enums matching the parser — an emitted property is checked against the schema's enums before conversion, so a looser schema would advertise operators to a lowering rule that the parser then rejects. Weights must be 1–100. An `affinity` with no arm set is rejected, as is a node selector term with neither `matchExpressions` nor `matchFields` — upstream documents such a term as matching no nodes, so it can only be a mistake. The published schema marks `nodeSelectorTerms`, and a weighted arm's `preference` and `podAffinityTerm`, as required — the parser already refused each of them being absent, so this changes what schema introspection reports, not what builds. | additive |
| `tolerations` | array | The same property `daemonset` already publishes, from the same parser, now covering the complete `corev1.Toleration`: `key`, `operator` (`Exists`/`Equal`/`Lt`/`Gt`), `value`, `effect`, `tolerationSeconds`. `tolerationSeconds` is a pointer upstream, so unset (tolerate forever) and `0` (evict immediately) are different documents. A non-empty `key` must be a qualified name; the empty key stays legal and is governed by the rule below. Cross-field rules: an empty `key` requires `Exists`; a `value` under `Exists` is refused; under `Equal` the `value` must be a valid label value, since it is matched against a taint's; `Lt`/`Gt` need a canonical decimal integer `value` (no leading zeros, no plus sign, no `-0` — `Toleration.ToleratesTaint` runs `content.IsDecimalInteger` before parsing and silently matches nothing otherwise) and the cluster's `TaintTolerationComparisonOperators` gate; `tolerationSeconds` requires `effect: NoExecute` spelled out, an omitted effect not counting as a wildcard for this rule. An unrecognised key is reported rather than dropped, and so is `tolerations` authored as something other than an array. | additive for `deployment`; **narrowing for `daemonset`** — see below |
| `topologySpreadConstraints` | array | `maxSkew` (required, > 0), `topologyKey` (required), `whenUnsatisfiable` (required, `DoNotSchedule`/`ScheduleAnyway`), `labelSelector`, `minDomains` (> 0, and only with `DoNotSchedule`), `nodeAffinityPolicy`/`nodeTaintsPolicy` (`Honor`/`Ignore`), `matchLabelKeys`. Two constraints may not repeat the same `(topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable)` **pair**; sharing a `topologyKey` with different `whenUnsatisfiable` values is legal and stays accepted. The three required fields carry no `omitempty` upstream, so an unset one would emit `maxSkew: 0` / `topologyKey: ""` / `whenUnsatisfiable: ""` rather than an API default — hence required here rather than defaulted. | additive |

##### What `tolerations` changed for `daemonset`

`affinity` and `topologySpreadConstraints` are new properties on a kind that did
not have them, so they are additive outright. `tolerations` is not: `deployment`
reaches it through the *same* `parseTolerations`/`schemaTolerations` pair that
`daemonset` has always used, and those two kinds were its only callers then, so
completing the projection changed `daemonset` too. (A kind that gained
`tolerations` later, `statefulset`, `job` and `cronjob` in go-kure/launcher#790, had no earlier
behaviour to change: for it the property is additive.) Stating that plainly, per
rule, because "additive" on its own would be false:

| change | effect on `daemonset` | why it is kept rather than gated to `deployment` |
|---|---|---|
| A well-formed `tolerationSeconds` is now read | **Additive in capability, and the one change that alters emitted bytes.** The key was previously accepted and silently dropped, so a `daemonset` that already authored it emitted a toleration without an eviction deadline; it now emits the field it asked for. That is a deliberate output change, not a preservation. | It is the fix, not a side effect. |
| A **malformed** `tolerationSeconds` is now an error | **New errors only.** A non-integer, fractional or out-of-int64-range value was previously ignored along with the rest of the key; it is now type-checked like any other integer property. | The key cannot be both read and unvalidated. A document carrying one was already not getting the deadline it asked for. |
| `operator: Lt` and `operator: Gt` are now accepted | **Purely additive.** Both were previously refused as invalid operators; they are valid `corev1` values (`core/v1/types.go:4097-4100`). Their `value` must be a canonical decimal integer — no leading zeros, no plus sign, no `-0` — because the scheduler's own matcher silently refuses to match any other form. | A "raw" projection whose operator set is narrower than the API's is the wrong shape for either kind. |
| An unrecognised key inside a toleration entry is now an error | **New errors only, and here output really is byte-identical.** A key the parser never read contributed nothing to the emitted object, so every document that still builds emits exactly what it emitted before. | `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` already states that an unrecognised key is a build error; this moves `daemonset` toward the documented contract rather than away from it. Gating it to `deployment` would leave `daemonset` permanently accepting shapes that do no work. |
| An empty `key` with a non-`Exists` operator is now an error | **New errors only, and only on documents the apiserver would have refused.** Upstream states it as a hard "must" (`k8s.io/api@v0.36.3` `core/v1/types.go:4093`). | Nothing appliable is lost. |
| `tolerations` authored as a mapping rather than an array is now an error | **New errors only, and output is byte-identical.** The whole property was previously discarded without a word — the parser's `[]any` assertion failed and it returned "absent", so a mistyped block emitted no tolerations at all and the build succeeded. Its two sibling parsers on the adjacent lines (`affinity`, `topologySpreadConstraints`) already rejected the same mistake, so this removes an inconsistency rather than adding a rule. | A silently discarded property is the failure mode this whole projection exists to remove; leaving `daemonset` on the old behaviour would keep the one parser that swallows a typo. |
| An explicit null on a toleration's `key`, `operator`, `value` or `effect` now reads as omission | **Fewer errors, and output is byte-identical for everything that already built.** Such an entry previously failed conversion with `must be a string, got <nil>`; it now behaves as if the key were absent, which is this package's null-as-omission convention. Only `null` is affected — an empty string is unchanged, so `operator: ""` is still an error rather than a silent default. | The null cannot be filtered before it arrives: `withoutExplicitNulls` strips only top-level properties, so an author writing a nested null reaches the parser with it intact. `ValidateAuthoredProperties` (`pkg/oam/property_validate_authored.go`) does shape-check authored documents, but its reach stops at any path that skips it entirely — a component a lowering rule constructs directly in Go, or a built-in parser's own field read, this file among them (`pkg/oam/README.md`'s "Scope" paragraph) — which is why the parser has to answer for itself and why these guards stay. A lowering rule's emitted null under an optional declared key is now normalised to absence before conversion (same file, `validateObjectProperties`), so the two paths agree on what a null means rather than one accepting what the other refuses. Leaving `daemonset` out would keep one kind refusing documents the schema declares valid. |
| A `value` under `operator: Exists` is now an error | **New errors only, and only on documents the apiserver would have refused** — upstream's `ValidateTolerations` rejects the pair outright, notwithstanding the field doc's softer "should" (the citation, and its second-hand provenance, are at the check itself in `common.go`). | Same: nothing appliable is lost. |
| A non-empty `key` that is not a qualified name is now an error | **New errors only, and only on documents the apiserver would have refused.** `ValidateTolerations` applies `ValidateLabelName` to every non-empty key, unconditionally and behind no feature gate. The empty key is untouched — it remains legal and keeps its own rule. | Nothing appliable is lost, and it is the same rule the affinity and topology-key paths already apply to their own label keys; `daemonset` accepting a malformed key there and not here was an inconsistency, not a policy. |
| Under `operator: Equal`, a `value` that is not a valid label value is now an error | **New errors only, and only on documents the apiserver would have refused.** The value is matched against a taint's value, so upstream runs `IsValidLabelValue` on it for the `Equal` arm. `Exists` and `Lt`/`Gt` reach their own value rules first, so this fires on `Equal` alone. | Same: nothing appliable is lost. |
| `tolerationSeconds` without `effect: NoExecute` is now an error | **New errors, and *not* only on documents the apiserver would have refused** — this row is reason 2 below, not reason 1. Upstream rejects the pair outright, and an omitted `effect` does not satisfy the rule (it has to be spelled out), but the apiserver never saw the pair: `tolerationSeconds` was previously dropped along with the rest of the key (first row of this table), so the emitted toleration carried no deadline and applied cleanly. A document hitting this rule may well have built and been accepted by a cluster before. This one was deliberately left unenforced until now, on the stated grounds that the only reachable citation was a second-hand copy carried by a dependency; the comment named a first-hand citation as the condition for adding it, and that condition is now met. | A `tolerationSeconds` on any other effect is inert at best and refused at apply at worst, which is the failure class this projection exists to remove. Leaving it would also contradict the rule's own recorded condition. |

Net, stated by cause rather than by a count or a partition. A count here went
stale twice; the replacement then asserted that the classes were exclusive and
that exactly one of them contained previously-accepted documents, and both of
those were wrong too. Three failed summaries of the same table is a sign the
summary wants a different shape, so this one describes what the rows have in
common and makes no claim about which row a document lands in. A `daemonset`
document stops building for one of these reasons, and one document can hit
several at once:

1. **It was refused on apply anyway.** An empty `key` with a non-`Exists`
   operator, a `value` under `Exists`, a non-qualified non-empty `key`, an
   invalid label value under `Equal`. Nothing appliable is lost.
2. **Part of it was being discarded unread.** An unrecognised member inside an
   entry, `tolerations` authored as a mapping rather than an array, or a
   `tolerationSeconds` the parser never looked at — malformed, or well-formed
   but carrying an `effect` other than `NoExecute`.

Reason 2 is the one that matters, and it is not confined to documents that were
doing nothing: an entry can carry an unread member alongside tolerations that
worked, and a `tolerations` block authored as a mapping left the rest of the
workload building and being accepted. So a document rejected under reason 2 may
well have built **and been accepted by a cluster** before — it simply was not
getting what it asked for, and the apiserver never saw the part that was
dropped. Reading those fields, which is the fix, is what makes them visible.
There is no version of the fix that keeps these documents building and also
emits what they asked for.

Output is byte-identical for everything that still builds, **unless it authored a
well-formed `tolerationSeconds` with `effect: NoExecute`**, in which case the
field it wrote now appears — the defect being fixed, not a regression.

The table is not uniformly a tightening: some
rows go the other way, accepting or emitting what `daemonset` previously refused
or dropped — a well-formed `tolerationSeconds`, `operator: Lt`/`Gt`, and a nested
explicit null in a toleration entry. Read the middle column per row rather than
assuming a direction. This is pre-release `v1alpha1`; the change is
taken deliberately rather than hidden behind a `deployment`-only option whose
removal would depend on unrelated work landing.

One rule applies to both `affinity` terms and topology-spread constraints:
`matchLabelKeys` (and `mismatchLabelKeys` on a pod affinity term) cannot be set
without a `labelSelector`.

A second rule applies to `matchLabelKeys` only: none of its keys may already be
constrained by that `labelSelector`, in either `matchLabels` or
`matchExpressions`. `mismatchLabelKeys` is deliberately *not* held to it, even
though its upstream field doc reads as a mirror of `matchLabelKeys`': upstream's
validation only ever builds its forbidden-key set from `matchLabelKeys`, because
a `mismatchLabelKeys` entry is merged as a `NotIn` requirement and filtering
further on the same key is a legitimate thing to want. Enforcing the doc's
wording would refuse a document the API server accepts.

A third rule applies to the *entries* of both lists, and to a pod affinity term's
`namespaces`: every `matchLabelKeys` / `mismatchLabelKeys` entry must be a valid
label key (a qualified name), and every `namespaces` entry a valid DNS-1123
label. These are shape rules the API server enforces on apply, so a document
that fails them was never going to reach the cluster — accepting it here only
moves the failure from build time to admission time. That is the opposite
direction from the `mismatchLabelKeys` overlap rule declined just above: there,
upstream does not validate, so enforcing would be *stricter* than the API; here
it does, so accepting is *looser*. Both errors are worth avoiding and they are
not in tension.

An **empty** `labelSelector: {}` is accepted here, unlike on a volume claim's
`selector` where launcher refuses it. Upstream distinguishes the two: a null
`labelSelector` on a `PodAffinityTerm` matches no pods, while an empty one
matches every pod in scope. Refusing the empty form would make a real API shape
unexpressible.

These three keys live in the `deployment` handler's own property map, above the
`maps.Copy` calls that merge the shared pod-level and `DeploymentSpec`
fragments, and they must stay there. `maps.Copy` overwrites the destination, and
`worker` and `webservice` each set the four-key `affinity` shorthand in their
own map and *then* copy the shared pod-level fragment over it — so moving a raw
`affinity` into that fragment would silently replace the shorthand on both,
with no fixture moving to reveal it.

**Routing traits on a `deployment` need an explicit Service.** `expose`,
`ingress` and `httproute` are accepted on this kind — nothing restricts them —
but they are not self-sufficient here. `expose` lowers into `ingress` or
`httproute`, and both resolve an *implicit* backend through the component's own
service port. A `deployment` has no service port and emits no Service, so an
implicitly-backed route fails the build with a "has no service port" error.
Route to it by naming the target Service on the trait, with `serviceName` **and**
`servicePort` (`serviceName` requires `servicePort`; setting `servicePort` alone
routes to a Service named after the component). That Service must exist
independently — authored as a `manifests` component, or belonging to another
component in the package. Nothing in this kind creates it.

With automatic NetworkPolicy synthesis, a trait-level `serviceName` that differs
from the component name is an external backend: a `networkPolicy.trafficSources`
entry on such a trait lands its allow on the pods of the component that owns the
named Service (on `servicePort`), not on this component's. When no component in
the package owns that Service, no allow is synthesized for it and it stays
authored. A `serviceName` equal to the component name — like `servicePort` alone
— is treated as this component's own Service and keeps the allow here. `worker`
behaves the same way, and so do `daemonset` and `statefulset`, which emit no
Service either (go-kure/launcher#690): a `statefulset` routing to its governing
Service names that authored `service`, which owns it, so the allow lands on that
Service's selector.

**`scaler` is available on `deployment`**, as on `webservice` and `worker`. An HPA
scales the Deployment past its replica count, and the non-RWX guard below checks
only the component's effective replica count (authored, or the policy default),
so it cannot account for later HPA scaling. The `scaler` trait covers
that gap itself: `deployment` reports its first non-RWX claim to the trait
(`NonRWXClaim`), and the trait refuses an effective `maxReplicas` above 1 when
one is present (see "Non-RWX volumes"). `statefulset` is still excluded: besides
claims referenced from `volumes`, as on the other kinds, it has
per-pod claims from `volumeClaimTemplates`, so the question differs.

**`deployment` reports its pod template labels** (`PodTemplateLabels`), so a
same-name sibling group can tell that a `service` member selects this
Deployment's own pods, which the group's component-label policy already
covers (see `pkg/oam` "Same-name sibling groups"). `statefulset`, `daemonset`,
`job` and `cronjob` do not have the method, deliberately (go-kure/launcher#794,
item 3): its one reader is that group check, and `deployment` is the only pod
kind a lowering rule emits into a group (`webservice`, `worker`). A rule that
emits another pod kind into a group must add the method to that kind.

| Property | Type | Effect | Compatibility |
|----------|------|--------|---------------|
| `strategy` | object | `type` (**required when `strategy` is authored**) is `Recreate` or `RollingUpdate`; `rollingUpdate` may only accompany `RollingUpdate`, matching `ValidateDeploymentStrategy`, which marks it Forbidden under `Recreate`. Omitting `strategy` entirely writes nothing, leaving apiserver defaulting to supply `RollingUpdate` with 25%/25%. | additive |
| `strategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` | int ≥ 0 or percentage string | Same form `ValidatePositiveIntOrPercent` accepts: a non-negative integer, or a `^[0-9]+%$` string — so `+50%` is rejected, as upstream rejects it. Capped at 100%, matching the `IsNotMoreThan100Percent` call upstream makes on this field, and additionally required to be convertible by the rollout controller (see `maxSurge`). | additive |
| `strategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge` | int ≥ 0 or percentage string | Same form, **not** capped at 100%: `ValidateRollingUpdateDeployment` calls `IsNotMoreThan100Percent` on `maxUnavailable` only, so a surge above 100% is a legal Deployment and is accepted here. This is one of two places the Deployment contract differs from the DaemonSet one, which is why the two parsers are separate functions rather than one shared helper. Uncapped is not unbounded: the `^[0-9]+%$` form check accepts any run of digits, so a percentage too long for the rollout controller's own `strconv.Atoi` (`getIntOrPercentValueSafely`, which `ResolveFenceposts` calls) is rejected here, naming the field, rather than carried verbatim into the object to fail during a rollout with this component out of the message. The boundary is that conversion's, so nothing upstream accepts is refused here. | additive |
| `strategy.rollingUpdate` (both knobs zero) | — | Rejected: `ValidateRollingUpdateDeployment` refuses `maxUnavailable: 0` together with `maxSurge: 0`, a pair that can make no progress. It rejects **only** that pair — unlike the DaemonSet rule, which also rejects both being non-zero. `SetDefaults_Deployment` guards each field with its own `== nil` check, so authoring one knob does not suppress the other's 25% default and a lone authored zero is always legal. | additive |
| `minReadySeconds` | int ≥ 0 | Seconds a new pod must be ready before it counts as available. Must stay **below** the effective `progressDeadlineSeconds`, whose own API default is 600 — so `minReadySeconds: 600` alone is rejected here, exactly as the apiserver would reject the defaulted pair. | additive |
| `revisionHistoryLimit` | int ≥ 0 | Old ReplicaSets retained. `0` is meaningful (retain none) and distinguishable from unset. | additive |
| `paused` | bool | Pauses rollouts of the Deployment. | additive |
| `progressDeadlineSeconds` | int ≥ 0 | Must be **greater than** the effective `minReadySeconds`, the cross-field rule `ValidateDeploymentSpec` applies. Both halves are compared as *effective* values, because both have an API default a document may be leaving it to: `minReadySeconds` defaults to 0 (a non-pointer `int32`, so it has no unset state) and `progressDeadlineSeconds` defaults to 600. So the rule fires in both directions — `progressDeadlineSeconds: 0` alone is rejected against the defaulted 0, and `minReadySeconds: 600` alone is rejected against the defaulted 600 — and the error names, for each half, whether the value was authored or defaulted, since either can be a field the document never mentions. | additive |
| `selector`, `template` | — | Not authorable, and rejected with a message saying so rather than silently ignored. The selector is builder-managed (`app: <component>`) and immutable once the object exists; the pod template is projected from the component's own container and pod-level properties. | additive |
| any of the five `DeploymentSpec` properties above, authored as `null` (on `deployment`, `webservice` and `worker` alike); **and, on `deployment` only, any optional property of the kind** | — | Read as omission, not as a present-but-wrong type — including a typed nil, which is what a Go-constructed lowering rule produces when it assigns a nil map into an `any`. `pkg/oam`'s property validator already treats a null under an optional property as absent, so without this a component could satisfy the published schema and then fail during handler conversion. `parseDeploymentSpec` strips nulls itself, so the five fields above behave this way on `webservice` and `worker` too. The wider guarantee is the `deployment` kind's alone: there it covers the kind's whole **top-level** surface, so `replicas: null`, `workingDir: null`, `env: null` and the rest all read as unauthored and `replicas: null` takes the default 1. Since go-kure/launcher#394 this is no longer specific to `deployment` for a property read through one of the shared field helpers in `common.go`, which test presence with `authoredValue`, nor for the six parsers that used to read their own property with a bare map lookup rather than a helper — `envFrom`, `probes`, `lifecycle`, `securityContext`, `volumes`, `accessModes` — which were converted to the same primitive. Since go-kure/launcher#570 it also covers the top-level keys that were still answered with a bare lookup and then type-checked — `cronjob`'s `timeZone`, `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` and `failedJobsHistoryLimit`; `completionMode` on `job` and `cronjob`; `passthrough`'s `clusterScoped`; `inline` and `url` on `crd` and `manifests`; and `manifests`' `scopeOverrides` — so a null there, typed or untyped, now reads as omission instead of a wrong type. That mattered because `ValidateAuthoredProperties` does not strip a top-level null, so `kurel build` used to reach the refusal. **One deliberate exception, and it is not an oversight:** the `postStart`/`preStop` handler keys (`httpGet`, `exec`, `sleep`, `tcpSocket`) still answer presence with a bare lookup, because there the rule being enforced *is* presence — `lifecycle: {preStop: {tcpSocket: null}}` must stay a refusal, since reading it as absence would let an authored-but-empty `tcpSocket` vanish and a valid sibling handler win silently, which is the exact silent-drop the surrounding paragraph rejects. The exception covers a probe's handler keys (`httpGet`, `tcpSocket`, `exec`, `grpc`) as well: `countProbeHandlers` reads them the same way, for the same reason, so a null one is refused too. Absence and authored-null are genuinely different documents for those handler keys. A `null` on a field that is required once its parent is authored (`strategy.type`) surfaces as the requiredness error, not a type error; `selector`/`template` are not optional properties, so naming either as `null` still earns the refusal above. **It now reaches nested keys too** — `securityContext: {runAsUser: null}` builds as if `runAsUser` were omitted. That fix deliberately sits *inside* each nested parser, after its unknown-key rejection, rather than in a recursive pre-strip over the property map: a recursive strip would remove `securityContext: {bogusKey: null}` before `parseSecurityContext`'s own rejection ever saw it, turning a named refusal into silence — trading one silent-drop bug for another. So a recognized nested key read through the helpers treats a null as absence, and an unrecognized one is still named and refused; both sides of that `securityContext` boundary are pinned in `deployment_nested_null_test.go`. The two nested map readers that used to read each entry raw now skip a null entry too, as `stringMapStrict` already did: `parseResourceList` (a `resources.requests`/`limits` quantity, where property validation deletes a null first only under the declared `cpu` and `memory` keys) and `parseLabelMap` (a `nodeSelector`, `service` `selector` or `matchLabels` value). As with `securityContext`, the skip comes after the key check: an invalid resource name or label key is still refused whatever its value, and a wrongly typed entry is still refused. A map left empty by the skip meets the empty-map refusal where one exists — `service`'s `selector: {app: null}` is refused as `selector: {}` is, rather than emitting a selector-less Service. | additive |

Every field above is presence-gated: a document that authors none of them
produces the same object the builder produced before, so the apiserver's own
defaults still apply rather than being frozen into the manifest.

An existing `webservice` or `worker` document that authors none of the five
builds byte-identically, and the two rules that look like new restrictions are
reachable only through them: a `strategy` contradicting the non-RWX guard, and
the `selector`/`template` refusals. The one visible change to a document
authoring none of them is the wording of the non-RWX replica refusal, now the
shared message ("a non-RWX PVC allows at most one replica") rather than each
kind's own; the documents it refuses are exactly the ones it refused before.

**A document that *was* authoring one of the five keys is a different case, and
it is not covered by "additive".** These kinds did not previously refuse those
keys as unknown — they ignored them. A handler reads the properties it knows
and drops the rest, and at the time this paragraph was first written the
authored path had no shape check of its own: `validateProperties` runs on
*emitted* elements only (`pkg/oam/property_validate.go`), and `validate.go`
checks type names and identity but not property shape. So `strategy` on a
`webservice` was accepted and silently discarded before go-kure/launcher#341,
and is honoured after it. Such a document kept building but compiled to a
different Deployment, and one authoring a malformed value now fails the build
where it previously succeeded.

Under the additive test in `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` — every previously valid
document stays valid *and* compiles to the same output — that was not
additive. The gap was not this change's: it applied to every property ever
added to an existing kind, because the authored path did not enforce the
Parser Strictness that section promises. `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` § Parser
Strictness states that an unrecognised key is a build error, which was true of
the document envelope and not of a component's `properties` map. **Since
go-kure/launcher#408 (closed), it is true of both:** `kurel build` now calls
`ValidateAuthoredProperties` (`pkg/cmd/kurel/build.go:149`, after parameter
resolution so a package-mode `${...}` placeholder is not checked against its
own bare-string type), which walks declared keys and shapes on the authored
document itself. An authored `strategy` malformed enough to fail that check now
fails there, before the handler ever sees it.

**`replicas` is validated the same way on every kind that reads it** —
`deployment`, `webservice`, `worker`, `statefulset` and `postgresql` share one
checked reading (`parseReplicas`, `common.go`). A value that is not an integer
is an error naming its type (`replicas: must be an integer, got string`), and a
negative is an error naming the value (`replicas: must be >= 0, got -1`).
Absent or `null` takes the default 1. `replicas: 0` is accepted everywhere.
An authored count, including 0 and 1, wins over a policy `DefaultReplicas`;
only an absent or `null` one takes it.
Before go-kure/launcher#393 only the `deployment` handler did this. The
other handlers fell back to the default when the value would not convert, and
carried `replicas: -1` through to an object the apiserver then refused
(`ValidateDeploymentSpec` and `ValidateStatefulSetSpec` run
`ValidateNonnegativeField` on it). What that changes in practice differs by
entry point:

- **`kurel build`** already refused a non-integer on every kind through the
  authored-property check (see above). The change it sees is the negative
  count, which is now a build error on those kinds too.
- **A library caller that runs the handlers without
  `ValidateAuthoredProperties`** used to get one replica for
  `replicas: "3"` without any error. It now gets the handler's own error.

**Every integer property accepts every Go integer kind.** The shared readers
(`toInt32`/`toInt64`, `parsePort`, the history limits, quantity and whole-number
rendering in `common.go`) read through `oam.IntegerValue`. So a `uint16` port or an
`int8` history limit from a lowering rule or a Go caller reads like the `int` a YAML
literal decodes to. Each reader then checks the value against its own target (a port
is 1–65535, a count fits `int32`) and refuses it with an error rather than truncating
or wrapping (go-kure/launcher#525). That includes the main and sidecar container
ports. (`daemonset`/`statefulset` read `port: 0` as "no port" until they
dropped `port`, go-kure/launcher#690.)

**Non-RWX volumes.** A `ReadWriteOnce` (or `ReadWriteOncePod`) claim cannot be
held by an outgoing and an incoming pod at once, so the handler allows **at
most one replica** (`replicas: 0` is a deliberate scale-to-zero and is accepted
rather than coerced to 1) and forces `strategy.type: Recreate`. The
scale-to-zero exemption covers the replica count only: the strategy is still
forced, and an authored `RollingUpdate` still refused, at zero replicas —
scale-to-zero is a state a later edit can leave by changing one number, and a
`RollingUpdate` that survived the guard while at zero would be wrong the moment
the first pod starts. Kubernetes rejects neither
combination — the second pod simply hangs unschedulable or stuck attaching — so
this is a build-time guard, not a mirror of an apiserver rule. An authored
`strategy.type: RollingUpdate` in that situation is **rejected** rather than
overwritten, so a document never ships a strategy its author did not write.
That refusal reaches `webservice` and `worker` only now that they publish
`strategy` at all; before go-kure/launcher#341 those two substituted `Recreate`
silently, because there was no authored value to contradict. `deployment`,
`webservice` and `worker` all run the one `applyNonRWXConstraint`.

That guard checks the component's effective replica count, but a `scaler`
trait's HPA scales the same Deployment up to `maxReplicas`, which the guard
cannot see. So on `deployment`, `webservice` and
`worker` the trait is held to the same limit: with a non-RWX claim attached, an effective
`maxReplicas` above 1 fails the build with an error naming the `scaler` trait
and the claim's volume. "Effective" means after an EnvironmentPolicy
`scalerMaxReplicas` default is applied. `maxReplicas: 1` still builds. On
`webservice` and `worker`, a document that combined the two used to build and
then left pods 2 and up unschedulable or stuck attaching; it is now refused
as a pre-GA format change (`docs/oam/design-gvk.md` § Document-Format
Lifecycle). On
`deployment` the combination was never accepted, because `scaler` was not
admitted there: the trait is newly admitted with this safeguard in place.

The guard reads a claim's **whole** access-mode set, not each mode on its own.
`accessModes` requests a volume supporting *every* mode listed, so
`[ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany]` binds a volume many pods can mount read-write
and is left unconstrained — replicas above one and a rolling update are both
fine. `[ReadWriteOnce]` or `[ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany]` still constrain the
workload: neither makes the read-write mount shareable. The test is per claim,
so one shareable claim does not excuse a second `ReadWriteOnce`-only one on the
same component. `ReadWriteOncePod` never appears beside another mode — the API
forbids the combination and the parser rejects it — so it is always constraining.

That guard is one helper shared with `webservice` and `worker`, so reading the
whole set **changes what those two kinds build** for a pre-existing document
whose claim declares `[ReadWriteOnce, ReadWriteMany]`: `replicas: 2` used to be
a build error and now succeeds, and a single-replica document used to ship
`strategy.type: Recreate` and now ships no strategy at all, leaving the
apiserver's `RollingUpdate` default to apply. This is the one place in this
change where an existing document's output moves. It is deliberate and
one-directional — the correction only accepts documents that were being
refused, and only stops forcing a strategy the author never wrote — and it is
not scoped to the new kind, because scoping it would leave `webservice` and
`worker` refusing volumes Kubernetes shares happily. Both halves are pinned per
kind (`rwx_shared_helper_test.go`).

## Policy defaults & enforcement ordering

A container's effective cpu/memory requests and limits are assembled in three
tiers, in precedence order:

1. **Authored** — whatever the component's `resources` property set explicitly.
2. **Policy default** — `ApplyPolicy` fills any request/limit the author left
   unset from `oam.Policy.DefaultCPURequest()`/`DefaultMemoryRequest()`/
   `DefaultCPULimit()`/`DefaultMemoryLimit()` (`enforce.go`'s
   `applyDefaultQuantity`). A negative policy default fails the build, as a
   negative authored quantity does, since Kubernetes would refuse it at apply;
   zero is accepted.
3. **Intrinsic handler default** — `buildResourceRequirements` (`common.go`)
   fills anything still unset at `Generate()` time: 100m CPU request, 128Mi
   memory request, and a memory limit mirroring the (possibly just-defaulted)
   memory request.

`oam.Policy.MaxCPU()`/`MaxMemory()` are enforced against the *effective*
value — what `Generate()` will actually emit, after all three tiers — not
just the authored/policy-defaulted `resources` field. Prior to go-kure/launcher#251
the enforcement check ran before the intrinsic tier was computed, so an
application that omitted `spec.resources` entirely could ship a Deployment
whose 100m CPU / 128Mi memory intrinsic defaults exceeded the enforced
maximum. `enforceMaxResources` (`enforce.go`) closes this by calling the same
`buildResourceRequirements` the generator calls, enforcing against its
result, and discarding it — `buildResourceRequirements` deep-copies its
maps, so this is read-only and generated output is unchanged. When a value
came from the intrinsic tier specifically (absent from the authored/policy-
defaulted value, present only after the intrinsic fallback), the error names
it as a "generated default" so the mismatch isn't mysterious.

This three-tier effective-value enforcement applies to the seven kind
components that call `buildResourceRequirements` on their main container
(`webservice`, `worker`, `deployment`, `cronjob`, `job`, `statefulset`,
`daemonset`).
**`postgresql` is exempt**: its lowering rule copies every entry of
`c.Resources` straight onto the Cluster spec (`cnpgResourceList`) and never calls
`buildResourceRequirements`, so it has no intrinsic tier for its existing
direct-form checks to diverge from.

Init containers and sidecars receive the same intrinsic defaults
(`common.go`'s `buildResourceRequirements` call sites at the init-container
and sidecar builders), and `ApplyPolicy` enforces them too (go-kure/launcher#312):
each entry's resources, image registry, `securityContext.privileged`, and
`securityContext.capabilities.add` are checked against the same policy
methods the main container uses, via the shared `enforceExtraContainer`
helper (`enforce.go`). All seven kind components enforce their
`initContainers`; only `webservice`, `worker`, `deployment`, `statefulset`
and, since go-kure/launcher#790, `daemonset` have a
`sidecars` schema key at all (`cronjob`/`job` have no sidecars support,
per "Per-type highlights" below) so only those five enforce a sidecars
loop. Errors name the authored list position and container, e.g.
`initContainers[0] "init": image "docker.io/x/y:v1" is not from an allowed
registry [...]`.

The twelve JobSpec-level properties (see "Per-type highlights" below) are parsed
and applied by a dedicated `JobSpecConfig`/`parseJobSpec`/`applyJobSpec`
(`common.go`), factored out separately from the fields above because
`batchv1.CronJob.Spec.JobTemplate.Spec` and a bare `batchv1.Job.Spec` are the
same `batchv1.JobSpec` type. `cronjob` projects them onto
`spec.jobTemplate.spec` and `job` (go-kure/launcher#344) onto its own
`spec`; both publish the identical key set, pinned by
`TestJobSpecSchemaMatchesParser` against `jobSpecPropertyKeys`.

**One JobSpec field is deliberately not shared: `suspend`.** `batchv1` carries
two distinct Suspend fields — `CronJobSpec.Suspend` (stop starting new
executions of the schedule) and `JobSpec.Suspend` (create the job with no pods)
— and `cronjob` already published `suspend` for the first of them. Putting a
`suspend` in the shared fragment would write one authored value into two
different API fields, and would silently overwrite `cronjob`'s own schema entry,
since each handler merges the shared fragment with `maps.Copy` *after* its own
literal map. So `job` publishes and parses its own JobSpec-level `suspend`
instead, and `cronjob`'s stays CronJobSpec-level with no key for the job-template
one. Both halves are pinned: `TestSchemaJobSpec_HasNoSuspendKey` on the schema,
`TestCronjobHandler_SuspendWritesCronJobSpecOnly` and
`TestJobHandler_SuspendWritesJobSpec` on the generated objects.

`applyJobSpec` copies every value it writes rather than assigning the config's
own pointers (`copyPtr` for the scalars, `DeepCopy` for `successPolicy` and
`podFailurePolicy`, which each own a slice of rules). A handler config outlives one `Generate` call and
`Generate` may run more than once, so an aliased pointer would leave a mutable
path from the generated object back into the config — a writer through the
object would change what the next `Generate` emits.

## Policy refusal classes

Every refusal by the environment policy this package raises is an `oam.PolicyRefusal` with
a class, which a consumer reads from `oam.ViolationError.Class` instead of matching text
(go-kure/launcher#849). The classes, what each covers and what stays unclassified are in
`pkg/oam/README.md`, "Refusal classes". What is particular to this package:

- **The class does not depend on the path.** A privileged container is
  `oam.RefusalPrivileged` on a workload kind's own `ApplyPolicy`, on an operator CR's pod
  template, on an object a chart renders, and on a `passthrough` or `manifests` object, at
  the transform and at generation: one check raises it (`enforce.go`,
  `enforcePodTemplatePolicy`, `enforceRenderedObjectPolicy`).
- **cpu and memory are one class, storage another.** The comparison with a maximum is
  shared and its text is the same for every resource, so the class comes from the caller:
  `oam.RefusalResourceMaximum` for a cpu or memory request or limit (a container's, a
  pod's, the block a CloudNativePG kind or an `alertmanager` carries, and the pod template of an ACME HTTP01
  solver on an `issuer` or a `clusterissuer`), `oam.RefusalStorageMaximum` for a claim's
  request, a claim template's, a generic ephemeral volume's, a PersistentVolume's capacity
  and a `cnpg-cluster` volume, the `1Gi` fallback of `postgresql` included, which its
  post-policy step holds to the maximum. `oam.RefusalReplicaMaximum` covers `replicas`, a
  HorizontalPodAutoscaler's `maxReplicas` and `cnpg-cluster`'s `instances`.
- **Secret material in the document is `oam.RefusalExplicitSecret`:** a `secret`
  component, a Secret that `passthrough` or a `manifests` source carries, `helmtemplate`'s
  `secretValues`, a `certificate`'s keystore password (`keystores.jks.password`,
  `keystores.pkcs12.password`), and in a `secretstore` or a `clustersecretstore` a
  credential written as a `value` and the data of the `fake` provider.
- **A source host is `oam.RefusalRegistry`,** as an image's registry is: the `url` of a
  `manifests` or `crd` source, a `helmtemplate` chart source, the Flux source kinds, an
  `oci://` url that does not name its registry, and a `bucket` endpoint on Amazon S3.
- **An object that cannot be read is `oam.RefusalUnreadableObject`** on the three paths that
  take an object written elsewhere (template delivery, `passthrough`, `manifests`): the
  refusals under "What cannot be read is refused, not passed" in the `passthrough` and
  `manifests` entries.
- **Unclassified, though it is the component's violation:** the rules that hold with or
  without a policy and are checked at the policy step (`ephemeralContainers` and the image
  rule on an object written elsewhere, an undeclared field on a workload or a claim a chart
  renders), a policy default or maximum that does not parse, and a chart that does not
  render or whose render does not decode (an `items` array on a kind that is no list, for
  one).
- **A redirect of a `manifests` `url` source to a host outside the allowed registries** is a
  fetch failure, with the error a fetch failure has and no `oam.ViolationError`; that error
  holds the `oam.PolicyRefusal` of class `oam.RefusalRegistry`, which `errors.As` reaches.

A new policy check in this package builds its refusal with `oam.NewPolicyRefusal` and a class
constant; `TestBuiltinPolicyRefusalsCarryAClass` (`pkg/oam`) fails on one that does not.

## Per-type highlights

Wrong-type handling for the optional top-level properties go-kure/launcher#405
moved onto the presence-reporting helpers: `port` on `webservice`, `daemonset`
and `statefulset` (the latter two have since dropped it, go-kure/launcher#690;
`parseInt32Field`; on `webservice` the `Endpoints` declaration runs the
rule's whole parse, so a wrong type is not declared as an endpoint on port 80
either, and neither is a component without an `image`; what the rule's
lowering refuses after the parse is one of the four things an endpoint entry
does not see, `pkg/oam`, "Name roles and the `Naming` hook"), `topologySpread` on `webservice` and
`worker` and `prune` on `oci` (`parseBoolField`), `serviceName` on
`statefulset` and `path`, `interval` and `targetNamespace` on `oci`
(`parseStringField`, so an authored `""` still reads as absent), and
`restartPolicy` on `cronjob` (read raw, as `job` reads it, so `""` still
reaches the enum refusal). A present value of the wrong type is rejected by
name (`topologySpread: must be a boolean, got string`) and a null reads as
absence. Before, each fell back to its default as though the key had been
omitted — `topologySpread: "false"` kept the spread constraints and
`prune: "false"` pruned — for a handler called directly; schema validation
already refused these shapes in an authored document. One authored shape does
change: `port` is declared `integer` with no maximum, so an integer outside the
int32 range (`port: 5000000000`) passed validation and built as though no port
were authored (80 on `webservice`, none on `daemonset`/`statefulset`); it is
now refused by value, not by type (`port: must be an integer within int32
range, got 5000000000`). `parseInt32Field` words that case apart from a wrong
type for every field it reads, so an out-of-range `replicas` or
`minReadySeconds` gets the same range message. `postgresql`'s other top-level
reads (`storageSize`, `backup`, `pooler`, …) were converted separately, in
go-kure/launcher#512 (see the `postgresql` entry below).

- **fluxcd-alert, fluxcd-provider, fluxcd-receiver, imagepolicy, imagerepository, imageupdateautomation, artifactgenerator, resourcesetinputprovider**
  (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections of objects of the
  Flux APIs beside the sources, the HelmRelease and the Kustomization: a
  notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta3 Alert and Provider, a
  notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 Receiver, an
  image.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1 ImagePolicy, ImageRepository and
  ImageUpdateAutomation, a
  source.extensions.fluxcd.io/v1beta1 ArtifactGenerator, and a
  fluxcd.controlplane.io/v1 ResourceSetInputProvider of the Flux Operator's
  API. Each is
  built on `policyFreeKind` (see the **storageclass** entry) with the Flux
  namespace, the check of its durations and, where a field names a host the
  environment policy holds, a check under that policy (`fluxKind`), and
  emits that one object, named
  after the component unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds no
  label, no annotation and no default. The type is `fluxcd-alert` rather
  than `alert`, which beside a `prometheusrule` would read as an alerting
  rule.

  **Nothing gates what a Flux object reaches outside its namespace, or the
  identity it acts under.** A Flux object may name objects of another
  namespace, and some may act under an account that is not their
  controller's. Launcher writes such a field as authored and refuses none,
  under a nil policy and a strict one alike: the environment policy has no
  rule for the namespace or the account a Flux object names, and
  `ApplyPolicy` checks neither here, as it checks neither on `helmrelease` (its
  `chart.spec.sourceRef.namespace`, `chartRef.namespace`,
  `serviceAccountName` and `kubeConfig`) and on `fluxcd-kustomization` (its
  `sourceRef.namespace`, `serviceAccountName` and `kubeConfig`). Whoever may
  author a component may author these fields, and a consumer that restricts
  them restricts the component types it registers.
  *Assumption, not read here:* a cluster's Flux controllers can be started so
  that they refuse a reference into another namespace. Launcher reads no such
  setting, and no build depends on it.

  **In the Flux namespace these objects share a namespace with every other
  application's Flux objects.** When a Flux namespace is set, the objects of
  this group land there (Namespace, below), and so do those of every other
  application built with that Flux namespace. A reference without a
  namespace, and a selector over "the object's namespace", then reach them:
  an Alert's `providerRef` may name another application's Provider, a
  Receiver's `resources` another application's Flux objects, an
  ImagePolicy's `imageRepositoryRef` another application's ImageRepository,
  the source of an ImageUpdateAutomation or of an ArtifactGenerator another
  application's source, a ResourceSetInputProvider's selector without a
  `namespace` another application's ExternalArtifacts, and an
  ImageUpdateAutomation without a
  `policySelector` takes every ImagePolicy there. An ImageRepository there
  is in the namespace of every other application's ImagePolicy, so a
  reference to it is not the cross-namespace one the API says `accessFrom`
  is for. Nothing gates this
  either, and no `namespace` has to be written for it.

  The fields, per kind:
  - `fluxcd-alert`: `eventSources[].namespace` names the namespace of the
    objects whose events are sent, and a source's `name: "*"` takes every
    object of its kind there, or, with `matchLabels`, every one that carries
    those labels. The events
    go to the Provider `providerRef` names, so an Alert sends what happens
    to another namespace's Flux objects to a receiver its author chose.
    `providerRef` holds a name and no namespace: the Provider is one of the
    namespace the Alert lands in. An Alert names no account.
  - `fluxcd-provider`: the object makes the notification controller send
    the events of the Alerts that name it to `address`, which the API calls
    "the endpoint, in a generic sense, to where alerts are sent" (for some
    types "a project ID or a namespace"), through `proxy` or the proxy the
    Secret of `proxySecretRef` holds. Both are hosts outside the cluster
    unless the receiver runs in it, and launcher writes both as authored.
    **`serviceAccountName` names the account the controller authenticates
    as:** in the API's words "the Kubernetes ServiceAccount used to
    authenticate with cloud provider services through workload identity",
    for the types `azureeventhub`, `azuredevops` and `googlepubsub`, and
    only with the controller's `ObjectLevelWorkloadIdentity` feature gate.
    The field holds a name and no namespace. *Assumption, not read here:* the
    controller takes the account from the namespace of the Provider, which
    in the Flux namespace holds the accounts of every application's Flux
    objects. Launcher writes it as authored and refuses none.
  - `fluxcd-receiver`: **a Receiver opens an inbound path on the
    notification controller.** A request there that the Receiver validates,
    by the procedure its `type` names ("the validation procedure and payload
    deserialization"), makes the controller reconcile the objects
    `resources` names. **`resources[].namespace` names the namespace of the
    objects a webhook makes the controller reconcile, and a resource's
    `name: "*"` takes every object of its kind there, or, with
    `matchLabels`, every one that carries those labels.** So a Receiver lets
    the sender of a webhook trigger the reconciliation of another
    namespace's Flux objects. The token a request is validated with is in
    the Secret `secretRef` names, one of the namespace the Receiver lands in;
    a `generic-oidc` Receiver validates a request by the OIDC issuers of
    `oidcProviders` instead. **`oidcProviders[].issuerURL` names a host
    outside the cluster**, which the controller discovers the issuer at;
    launcher writes it as authored and holds its host to no policy; a user
    or a password in it is refused (Policy, below). A Receiver names no
    account.
  - `imagepolicy`: `imageRepositoryRef.namespace` names the namespace of
    the ImageRepository whose scanned tags the policy selects from, so an
    ImagePolicy may name the ImageRepository of another namespace and read
    the tags it scanned. The API documents, on the
    ImageRepository, an `accessFrom` list "for allowing cross-namespace
    references to the ImageRepository object based on the caller's namespace
    labels"; launcher reads no ImageRepository to see whether the one named
    allows it. An ImagePolicy names no account.
  - `imagerepository`: the object makes its controller scan the tags of
    `image` at the registry that name holds, which is a host outside the
    cluster unless the registry runs in it. **`accessFrom` opens the
    ImageRepository to other namespaces:** the API calls it "an ACL for
    allowing cross-namespace references to the ImageRepository object based
    on the caller's namespace labels", its `namespaceSelectors` are joined
    by OR, and "an empty map of MatchLabels matches all namespaces in a
    cluster", so `accessFrom: {namespaceSelectors: [{}]}` opens the scanned
    tags to an ImagePolicy of any namespace. **`serviceAccountName` names
    the account the scan authenticates as:** in the API's words "the
    Kubernetes ServiceAccount used to authenticate the image pull if the
    service account has attached pull secrets". The field holds a name and
    no namespace. *Assumption, not read here:* the controller takes the
    account from the namespace of the ImageRepository, which in the Flux
    namespace holds the accounts of every application's Flux objects.
    **`insecure: true` "allows connecting to a
    non-TLS HTTP container registry".** **The proxy the registry is reached
    through is not in the object:** `proxySecretRef` names a Secret that
    holds its configuration, and no build sees that host. Launcher writes
    each of the four as authored and refuses none.
  - `imageupdateautomation`: `sourceRef.namespace` names the namespace of
    the GitRepository that, in the API's words, gives "access details to a
    git repository". **An ImageUpdateAutomation makes its controller commit
    to that repository and push**, to the branch the GitRepository or
    `git.checkout.ref` names, or to `git.push.branch` and `git.push.refspec`;
    so one that names another namespace's GitRepository writes to a
    repository with the access details that GitRepository gives. Nothing
    holds the
    branch or the refspec either. It names no account. The ImagePolicies
    whose selections it applies are those of the namespace it lands in
    (`policySelector` narrows them; it names no other namespace), and the
    Secret of `git.commit.signingKey` is one of that namespace too.
    **In the Flux namespace, an ImageUpdateAutomation without a
    `policySelector` selects every ImagePolicy there, those of other
    applications included** (the API: "By default includes all policies in
    namespace"), and the automation then commits their selections through
    its own GitRepository.
  - `artifactgenerator`: `sources[].namespace` names the namespace of a
    Flux source (a Bucket, GitRepository, OCIRepository, HelmChart or
    ExternalArtifact); left out, the API takes "the same namespace as the
    ArtifactGenerator". **An ArtifactGenerator copies files out of the
    sources it names into the artifacts it generates**, which the API
    describes as ExternalArtifacts, so one that names another namespace's
    source republishes that source's content as an artifact its author
    named. It names no account.
  - `resourcesetinputprovider`: the object makes the Flux Operator ask the
    provider its `type` names for input sets, which, in the API's words,
    "populate the inputs" of a ResourceSet; **the answer decides what that
    ResourceSet deploys.** Every type but `Static` and `ExternalArtifact`
    asks the host of `url` (Policy, below), with the credentials of the
    Secret `secretRef` names; an `ExternalService` provider sends that
    Secret's token or user and password to it. **An `ExternalArtifact`
    provider reads ExternalArtifacts of the cluster instead:
    `selectors[].namespace` names the namespace it lists them in, and
    `namespace: "*"` lists them "across all namespaces".** Left out, the
    namespace is the provider's own. **`serviceAccountName` names the
    account the operator acts as:** in the API's words the ServiceAccount
    "used for authentication with AWS, Azure or GCP services through
    workload identity federation features", taken, without one, from "the
    ServiceAccount of the operator". **For an `ExternalArtifact` provider,
    the list is made with the operator's own client unless an account is
    set**; with one, the operator lists as that account, of the namespace
    the object lands in. *Read from the controller of the linked module, not
    from the type:* an operator started with a default account lists as
    that account where none is set; launcher reads no operator setting, and
    the installed operator may differ from the linked one. Launcher writes
    the selectors and the account as authored and refuses none.

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec
  type, decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever
  it sits (a source, a reference, a policy).
  - `fluxcd-alert` (`AlertSpec`): `providerRef`, `eventSources`,
    `eventSeverity`, `inclusionList`, `exclusionList`, `eventMetadata`,
    `summary` (deprecated by the API for `eventMetadata`) and `suspend`.
  - `fluxcd-provider` (`ProviderSpec`): `type`, `interval` (in the API's
    words "Deprecated and not used in v1beta3"), `channel`, `username`,
    `address`, `timeout`, `proxy` (deprecated by the API for
    `proxySecretRef`), `proxySecretRef`, `secretRef`, `certSecretRef` (each a
    `name`), `serviceAccountName`, `suspend` and `commitStatusExpr`.
    **`commitStatusExpr` is a CEL expression the controller evaluates** to
    the message of a commit status; launcher writes it as authored and does
    not parse it.
  - `fluxcd-receiver` (`ReceiverSpec`): `type`, `interval`, `events`,
    `resources` (each an `apiVersion`, `kind`, `name`, `namespace`,
    `matchLabels` and `filter`), `resourceFilter`, `secretRef` (a `name`),
    `oidcProviders` (each an `issuerURL`, `audience`, `variables` and
    `validations`) and `suspend`. **`resourceFilter`, a resource's `filter`,
    and the `expression` of an OIDC variable and of an OIDC validation are
    CEL expressions the controller evaluates**; launcher writes them as
    authored and does not parse them.
  - `imagepolicy` (`ImagePolicySpec`): `imageRepositoryRef`, `policy`
    (`semver`, `alphabetical`, `numerical`), `filterTags`,
    `digestReflectionPolicy`, `interval` and `suspend`. An authored
    `filterTags` is written with both its `pattern` and its `extract`, the
    one left out as the empty string: the Go type omits neither.
  - `imagerepository` (`ImageRepositorySpec`): `image`, `interval`,
    `timeout`, `secretRef`, `proxySecretRef`, `certSecretRef` (each a
    `name`), `serviceAccountName`, `suspend`, `accessFrom`
    (`namespaceSelectors`, each a `matchLabels`), `exclusionList`,
    `provider` and `insecure`. `image` names a repository, such as
    `ghcr.io/org/app`; launcher does not parse it beyond its registry
    (Policy, below), and an entry of `exclusionList` is a regular expression
    it does not compile.
  - `imageupdateautomation` (`ImageUpdateAutomationSpec`): `sourceRef`,
    `git` (`checkout`, `commit`, `push`), `interval`, `policySelector`,
    `update` and `suspend`. `git.commit.messageTemplate` is a template the
    controller renders; launcher writes it as authored and does not parse
    it.
  - `artifactgenerator` (`ArtifactGeneratorSpec`): `commonMetadata`,
    `sources`, `pathPattern` and `artifacts` (each a `name`, `revision`,
    `originRevision` and `copy`; a copy a `from`, `to`, `exclude` and
    `strategy`). **`commonMetadata` is not the object's own metadata:** its
    `labels` and `annotations` are written into the spec, where the API says
    they are "applied to all resources", the ExternalArtifacts it generates;
    the ArtifactGenerator's own labels and annotations are the `labels` and
    `annotations` properties. At generation they are held to the reserved
    metadata keys (`pkg/oam` README, "Reserved metadata keys"), and not to
    the component label's value: an ExternalArtifact is no pod. Launcher
    writes nothing there. The
    aliases, the `@<alias>/…` paths and the `{capture}` placeholders are
    written as authored: launcher resolves none of them.
  - `resourcesetinputprovider` (`ResourceSetInputProviderSpec`): `type`,
    `url`, `serviceAccountName`, `secretRef`, `certSecretRef` (each a
    `name`), `insecure`, `defaultValues`, `filter` (`includeBranch`,
    `excludeBranch`, `includeTag`, `excludeTag`, `includeEnvironment`,
    `excludeEnvironment`, `labels`, `limit` and `semver`), `skip` (`labels`),
    `schedule` (each a `cron`, `timeZone` and `window`) and `selectors`
    (each a `name`, `namespace`, `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`).
    `defaultValues` is a free map, written as authored; the regular
    expressions of `filter`, its `semver` range and a schedule's `cron` are
    written as authored and not parsed.
  - **No default is filled.** The API's own (`eventSeverity: info`,
    `digestReflectionPolicy: Never`, a policy's `order: asc`,
    `update: {strategy: Setters}`, an ImageRepository's `provider: generic`
    and its `exclusionList` of `^.*\.sig$`, a Receiver's `interval: 10m`, a
    ResourceSetInputProvider's `filter.limit: 100` and a schedule's
    `timeZone: UTC`) is
    applied by the API server to what the object leaves out; the `timeout`
    of an ImageRepository left out is, in the API's words, the "'Interval'
    duration", and the `audience` of a Receiver's OIDC provider
    `notification-controller`, which are the controller's to apply. A
    schedule's `window` left out is written `0s`, the API's own default.
    One default cannot apply: `sourceRef.kind`, which
    the API defaults to `GitRepository` and the Go type writes empty when
    it is left out, an empty value being a value. It is required instead
    (below). `eventSeverity`, `digestReflectionPolicy`, a policy's `order`,
    `update.strategy`, an ImageRepository's `provider` and a schedule's
    `timeZone` are strings the
    type omits when empty, so an authored `""` on one would be left out and
    defaulted: it is refused (`eventSeverity: "" cannot be carried by the
    Flux API types (…)`). A ResourceSetInputProvider's `filter.limit: 0` is
    omitted the same way, and the API server would then apply its default
    100, so it is refused too (`filter.limit: 0 cannot be carried by the
    Flux Operator API types (…)`). `TestFluxKinds_DefaultedZeros` holds each
    kind's list of such fields to the numbers, booleans and strings that are
    omitted when zero and that the API defaults to something else. An
    authored empty `exclusionList` (`[]`) is not refused, and it does not
    mean that nothing is excluded: the type omits an empty list, so the
    object gets the API's default list (`^.*\.sig$`), and the controller also
    reads an empty list as that default.
  - **A duration is held to the pattern its field declares**, as on the Flux
    kinds below (go-kure/launcher#601): unsigned, in the units `ms`, `s`,
    `m` and `h`. A value outside it is refused (`imagepolicy: interval
    "-5m" is invalid: must be a Flux duration (…)`), and so is one below a
    millisecond, which would be written in a unit the pattern does not take
    (`0.5ms` as `500µs`). It is written as Go formats it (`10m` as
    `10m0s`). `TestFluxKinds_DurationsMatchMarkers` holds each kind's list
    of durations to its type and to the pattern markers of the linked
    source: the `interval` of a Receiver, of an ImagePolicy and of an
    ImageUpdateAutomation, and the `interval` and `timeout` of a Provider
    and of an ImageRepository, and the `window` of a ResourceSetInputProvider's
    schedule; an Alert and an ArtifactGenerator have none. **A schedule's
    `window` is held by its authored text:** it sits under a list, and a
    window of `500us` in any schedule is refused (`resourcesetinputprovider:
    schedule[].window "500us" is invalid: must be a Flux duration (…)`); its
    pattern takes `h`, so one is written as Go formats it (`90m` as
    `1h30m0s`).
    **The `timeout` of a Provider and of an ImageRepository takes no `h`:**
    its pattern holds the units `ms`, `s` and `m`, so `1h` is refused
    (`imagerepository: timeout "1h" is invalid: must be a Flux duration
    (…)`) and `60m` is not.
    Go formats an hour or more with an `h`, which the pattern would refuse
    at apply, so such a timeout is written in minutes (`90m` as `90m0s`),
    as the timeout of a Flux source is (go-kure/launcher#619).

  **Required** is a field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or
  not it was authored, the rule every kind follows (see the Prometheus
  operator's kinds below). Each must be authored (`providerRef: required
  (…)`, `eventSources[1].name: required (…)`); an authored empty value is a
  value, and the API server's to refuse.
  - A `fluxcd-alert`: `providerRef` with its `name`, and `eventSources`; of
    each source its `kind` and `name`.
  - A `fluxcd-provider`: `type`; of an authored `secretRef`,
    `proxySecretRef` or `certSecretRef` its `name`.
  - A `fluxcd-receiver`: `type` and `resources`; of each resource its `kind`
    and `name`; of an authored `secretRef` its `name`; of each OIDC provider
    its `issuerURL` and `validations`, of each validation its `expression`
    and `message`, of each variable its `name` and `expression`.
  - An `imagepolicy`: `imageRepositoryRef` with its `name`, and `policy`; of
    a `semver` policy its `range`.
  - An `imagerepository`: `interval`; of an authored `secretRef`,
    `proxySecretRef` or `certSecretRef` its `name`; of an authored
    `accessFrom` its `namespaceSelectors`. **`image` is required too, by
    another rule:** the API requires it and the Go type leaves an empty one
    out, so the kind refuses a component without it, and one whose `image`
    is authored empty (`image: required (…)`).
  - An `imageupdateautomation`: `sourceRef` with its `kind` and `name`, and
    `interval`. Of an authored `git`, `commit` with its `author` and the
    author's `email`; of an authored `git.checkout`, its `ref`; of an
    authored `git.commit.signingKey`, its `secretRef` with its `name`. Of a
    match expression of `policySelector`, its `key` and its `operator`
    (`policySelector.matchExpressions[0].operator: required (…)`); its
    `values` and the operator's value are the API server's.
  - An `artifactgenerator`: `sources` and `artifacts`; of each source its
    `alias`, `kind` and `name`; of each artifact its `name` and `copy`; of
    each copy its `from` and `to`.
  - A `resourcesetinputprovider`: `type`; of an authored `secretRef` or
    `certSecretRef` its `name`; of each schedule its `cron`. Of a match
    expression of a selector, its `key` and its `operator`
    (`selectors[0].matchExpressions[0].operator: required (…)`); its
    `values` and the operator's value are the API server's.

  **The lists are read from the markers of the Go source, not from a CRD.**
  The API modules of the Flux controllers hold the Go types and ship no CRD;
  the Flux Operator's module ships its CRDs, and its list is read the same
  way. `TestFluxKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers` derives each list from the
  `+required` markers of the linked modules' source, as the kinds of the
  Prometheus operator's API are derived: every field so marked that the type
  writes unauthored is listed, and nothing else is. The `key` and `operator`
  of a match expression belong to a Kubernetes type with no such marker, and
  are read from its source by the schema generators' rule, as there: a field
  with no optional marker whose json tag keeps it when empty is required. A
  dependency bump that
  adds, drops or moves one fails there. Nothing here is held to the API
  server's own validator, which answers from a CRD. **Not refused:**
  - a list the API wants an item of that is authored empty
    (the `sources`, `artifacts` and `copy` of an `artifactgenerator`), and
    one longer than the API allows;
  - every value rule of the API but the pattern of a duration: enumerations
    (`eventSeverity`, a source's `kind`, `digestReflectionPolicy`, a
    policy's `order`), lengths (a source's `name` and `namespace`,
    `summary`), and that a source with `matchLabels` is named `*`, which
    the type documents and no marker states;
  - a `policy` that names none of `semver`, `alphabetical` and `numerical`,
    or more than one: the type calls it a union, and no marker holds it to
    one;
  - of a `fluxcd-provider`, the enumeration of `type`, the lengths of
    `channel`, `username`, `address` and `proxy`, and the pattern of `proxy`
    (an `http` or `https` URL); an `address` that is no URL with a host is
    written as authored unless it holds an `@` (Policy, below);
  - of a `fluxcd-receiver`, the enumerations (`type`, a resource's `kind`),
    the lengths of a resource's `name` and `namespace`, the pattern of an
    `issuerURL` (an `http` or `https` URL; one that parses with no host is
    written as authored unless it holds an `@`, and one that does not parse
    is refused without naming the value), a `validations` list authored
    empty, two OIDC providers of one `issuerURL`, which the type keys the
    list by, and that a resource with `matchLabels` is named `*`, which the
    type documents and no marker states;
  - of an `imagerepository`, the enumeration of `provider`, the length of
    `serviceAccountName`, an `exclusionList` of more than 25 entries, an
    `accessFrom` whose `namespaceSelectors` is authored empty, and whether
    `image` is a repository name the controller accepts: one that carries a
    tag or a digest is written as authored;
  - an `imageupdateautomation` with no `git`, which the type documents as
    "technically optional, but in practice mandatory" and no marker
    requires; the pattern of `git.push.refspec` and the enumerations
    (`sourceRef.kind`, `update.strategy`, a signing key's `type`);
  - of an `artifactgenerator`, the patterns (a source's `alias`, `name` and
    `namespace`, `pathPattern`, an artifact's `revision` and
    `originRevision`, a copy's `from` and `to`), the lengths and the
    enumerations (a source's `kind`, a copy's `strategy`); that an alias is
    unique and that a path, a `revision` or an `originRevision` names an
    alias that is declared, which the type documents and no marker states;
  - of a `resourcesetinputprovider`, the enumeration of `type`, the pattern
    of `url` (an `http`, `https` or `oci` URL) and the maximum of
    `filter.limit` (10000); the `url` scheme each type takes is an
    expression rule (below).

  **The APIs' expression rules are not checked.** A kind checks an
  expression rule only where the check is held to the API server's own
  validator, which answers from a CRD (go-kure/launcher#874), and the linked
  modules of the Flux controllers' APIs ship none. **The Flux Operator's
  module does ship its CRDs, and the `resourcesetinputprovider` kind
  deliberately checks none of their rules:** it leaves every one to the API
  server, as the other Flux kinds do. A component that breaks one of the rules
  below builds, and the API server refuses the object at apply.
  `TestFluxKinds_ExpressionRules` reads every such rule from the markers of
  the linked source and holds the list (`fluxRulesLeft`) to them, and
  `TestFluxOperatorKinds_ExpressionRulesMatchCRD` holds the
  ResourceSetInputProvider's list to the `x-kubernetes-validations` of the
  shipped CRD, in both directions, so a dependency bump that adds, drops or
  rewords one fails there.
  - The types of an Alert, of an ImageRepository and of an
    ImageUpdateAutomation declare none.
  - A `fluxcd-provider`: `commitStatusExpr` set on a `type` other than
    `github`, `gitlab`, `gitea`, `bitbucketserver`, `bitbucket` and
    `azuredevops`. It builds and is refused at apply.
  - A `fluxcd-receiver`: a `generic-oidc` receiver without an OIDC provider
    or with a `secretRef`, and a receiver of another type with
    `oidcProviders` or without a `secretRef`. Each builds and is refused at
    apply.
  - An `imagepolicy`: `interval` without `digestReflectionPolicy: Always`,
    and `digestReflectionPolicy: Always` without `interval`. Each builds and
    is refused at apply.
  - An `artifactgenerator`: where no `pathPattern` is set, every artifact's
    `name` must be a Kubernetes object name (lower case letters, digits,
    `-` and `.`). One that is not, `App_Manifests` for one, builds and is
    refused at apply.
  - A `resourcesetinputprovider`: seventeen rules, sixteen of them on the
    spec and one on a selector. `url` must be left out under `Static` and
    `ExternalArtifact` and written under every other type, with the scheme
    the type takes (`http` or `https` for a Git, AzureDevOps and
    `ExternalService` provider, `https` for AWSCodeCommit, `oci` with a
    repository after the registry for an OCI provider); `https` for an
    `ExternalService` provider unless `insecure` is true, and `insecure`
    only under `ExternalService` and `OCIArtifactTag`; `serviceAccountName`
    only under the AzureDevOps, AWSCodeCommit, artifact-tag and
    `ExternalArtifact` types; `secretRef` and `certSecretRef` not under
    the types that take none; `selectors` written under `ExternalArtifact`
    and only there; and a selector's `name` not beside `matchLabels` or
    `matchExpressions`. Each builds and is refused at apply.

  **Policy.** One dimension of the environment policy reaches two of these
  objects: the allowed registries hold the `image` of an `imagerepository`
  and the host of a `resourcesetinputprovider`'s `url`.
  No other dimension reaches any of them: they run no pod, request no
  storage and have no replica count.
  - **No field of an Alert holds a secret or a host.** The address and the
    credentials are the Provider's. `eventMetadata` is a free map, written to
    the object as authored under a policy that forbids explicit secrets too.
  - **A user or a password in a Provider's `address` or `proxy` is
    refused**, under every policy and under none, by the rule that refuses
    one in an inline chart source's URL (`fluxcd-provider: address must not
    carry a user or password, which would be written in plain text into the
    Provider; …`): it would sit in the object in plain text. An `address`
    or a `proxy` that is no URL with a host is refused when it holds an `@`
    (an `address` with no `@` passes, since the API allows a project ID or a
    namespace there); `bot:pw@host` and `bot@host` parse as URLs with no
    user, so parsing alone does not clear them. *Assumption, not read
    here:* for the webhook types the address itself is the credential and
    belongs in the Secret `secretRef` names, under an `address` key; the
    linked type says only that this Secret holds "the authentication
    credentials". **A token in the path or the query of an address is not
    something the kind can tell**, and is written as authored. **Not held:**
    the hosts of `address` and `proxy`: the Provider sends events there and
    fetches no artifact, so no dimension of the policy speaks of them;
    `serviceAccountName`. The credentials, the proxy configuration and the
    certificates of `secretRef`, `proxySecretRef` and `certSecretRef` are
    Secrets the object names, not values.
  - **No field of a Receiver holds an image or a secret.** The token is in
    the Secret `secretRef` names. **A user or a password in an OIDC
    provider's `issuerURL` is refused**, under every policy and under none,
    by the same rule as a Provider's `proxy` (`fluxcd-receiver:
    oidcProviders[1].issuerURL must not carry a user or password, which
    would be written in plain text into the Receiver; …`), and so is one
    that does not parse, or is no URL with a host and holds an `@`; the
    refusal names the
    provider's index, not the value. **The host of an OIDC provider's
    `issuerURL` is not held:** the controller discovers an issuer there and
    fetches no artifact, so no dimension of the policy speaks of it. That a
    Receiver opens an inbound path is not a dimension of the policy either.
  - **No field of an ImagePolicy holds an image, a secret or a host.** The
    image and the credentials of its registry are the ImageRepository's; the
    policy holds the rule by which one of that image's tags is selected.
    The allowed registries and the tag rule of the environment policy are
    not applied to it.
  - **The registry of an ImageRepository's `image` is held to the allowed
    registries**, by the rule that holds the image of a pod: under a policy
    that allows `registry.example`, `image: ghcr.io/shop/web` is refused
    (`image "ghcr.io/shop/web" is not from an allowed registry
    [registry.example]`, a refusal of the class `registry`). A name with no
    registry is one of `docker.io`, and a registry with a port is another
    registry than the one without. A policy that lists no registry refuses
    none, and neither does a build without a policy. **The tag rule is not
    applied:** the field names a repository, and the tags are what the scan
    finds. **Not held:** the host of the proxy, which is in the Secret
    `proxySecretRef` names; `insecure`, which no dimension of the policy
    speaks of; `provider` and `serviceAccountName`. The credentials, the
    proxy configuration and the certificates are Secrets the object names,
    not values, so a policy that forbids explicit secrets has nothing of it
    to refuse.
  - **No field of an ImageUpdateAutomation holds a secret or a host.** The
    address of the repository and its credentials are the GitRepository's,
    and the signing key is a Secret named by `git.commit.signingKey`, not a
    value. `git.commit.messageTemplateValues` and `git.push.options` are
    free maps, written to the object as authored under a policy that
    forbids explicit secrets too. **The images the automation writes into
    the repository are not held to the allowed registries or the tag
    rule:** they are what the ImagePolicies select at run time, and no
    build sees them.
  - **No field of an ArtifactGenerator holds a secret or a host.** The
    addresses and the credentials are those of the sources it names.
    `commonMetadata` holds two free maps, written to the object as authored
    under a policy that forbids explicit secrets too, and held to the
    reserved metadata keys alone at generation. **What an artifact
    carries is not checked:** the copy is the controller's to perform, and no
    build sees the files, so the rules a policy holds a workload or a Secret to
    do not reach manifests that travel inside an artifact.
  - **A user or a password in a ResourceSetInputProvider's `url` is
    refused**, under every policy and under none, by the same rule
    (`resourcesetinputprovider: url must not carry a user or password, which
    would be written in plain text into the ResourceSetInputProvider; …`):
    the credentials belong in the Secret `secretRef` names. A `url` that is
    no URL with a host is refused too when it holds an `@`, as a Provider's
    `proxy` is. **The host of
    `url` is held to the allowed registries, whatever the type:** the answer
    of that host decides what a ResourceSet deploys, the `ExternalService`
    call sends the referenced credential to it, and one rule holds a type a
    later operator version adds. An `oci://` url is held by the rule that
    holds an `ocirepository`'s: under a policy that lists registries it must
    name its registry explicitly and a repository after it. Every other url
    is held by the host rule of the Flux sources: under a policy that allows
    `registry.example`, `url: https://git.other.example/shop/fleet` is
    refused, a refusal of the class `registry`. A `Static` or
    `ExternalArtifact` provider has no `url` and nothing is held. A policy
    that lists no registry refuses none, and neither does a build without a
    policy. **Not held:** `serviceAccountName`, `insecure` and the
    selectors of an `ExternalArtifact` provider, which name no host; the
    inputs the provider returns, which the operator reads at run time and
    no build sees. `defaultValues` is a free map, written to the object as
    authored under a policy that forbids explicit secrets too.

  **Namespace.** The object lands in the Flux namespace when one is
  configured, else in the build namespace (`SetFluxNamespace`), as the Flux
  kinds below do, and its name is claimed there. A reference without a
  namespace of its own is written without one, under a Flux namespace too:
  launcher fills none in. The Flux objects of the same document
  (`helmrelease`, `fluxcd-kustomization`, the sources) land in the Flux
  namespace with it. `FluxNamespaceReads` reports the ConfigMaps and Secrets
  a kind reads by name from the namespace it lands in, so that a trait's
  object one of them names moves with it; an Alert, an ImagePolicy and an ArtifactGenerator read
  none, a Provider and an ImageRepository read the Secrets of `secretRef`,
  `proxySecretRef` and `certSecretRef`, a Receiver reads the Secret of
  `secretRef`, a ResourceSetInputProvider reads the Secrets of `secretRef`
  and `certSecretRef`, and an ImageUpdateAutomation reads
  the Secret of `git.commit.signingKey.secretRef`. The ServiceAccount of a
  Provider's, an ImageRepository's or a ResourceSetInputProvider's
  `serviceAccountName` is not reported: the report holds ConfigMaps and
  Secrets only.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.

  **Not covered.** Whether what is referred to exists (the Provider, the
  objects of a source, the ImageRepository, the GitRepository, the signing
  key's Secret, the sources of an ArtifactGenerator, the Secrets and the
  ServiceAccount of a Provider and of an ImageRepository, the resources and
  the Secret of a Receiver, the Secrets, the ServiceAccount and the
  ExternalArtifacts of a ResourceSetInputProvider), whether the registry of
  an ImageRepository answers and holds the repository, whether the address
  of a Provider, the issuer of a Receiver or the `url` of a
  ResourceSetInputProvider answers, whether a `commitStatusExpr` or a
  Receiver's CEL expression compiles,
  whether a `filterTags`
  pattern, a `semver` range, a commit message template, a `pathPattern`, a
  ResourceSetInputProvider's filter expression or a schedule's `cron`
  parses, and whether the cluster serves the API: the
  component builds where the CRD is not installed, and the object is refused
  at apply. The object's status is the controller's and is not written.
- **cnpg-imagecatalog**, **cnpg-clusterimagecatalog**, **cnpg-backup**,
  **cnpg-scheduledbackup**, **cnpg-databaserole**, **cnpg-publication**,
  **cnpg-subscription** (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections
  of seven objects of the CloudNativePG API, `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1`, beyond
  those of **cnpg-cluster** and **cnpg-pooler**, below: an
  ImageCatalog, a ClusterImageCatalog, a Backup, a ScheduledBackup, a
  DatabaseRole, a Publication and a Subscription. Each emits that one object,
  named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds no
  label, no annotation and no default of its own. **The ClusterImageCatalog
  is cluster-scoped**: the object carries no namespace, whatever namespace the
  application is built for, and its name is claimed cluster-wide. The other
  six are namespaced and are written in the build namespace. No rule lowers
  onto these kinds: `postgresql` emits none of them.

  **No capability is required, and nothing gates these kinds**: where the
  CloudNativePG CRDs are not installed the component builds. Whoever may
  author a component may author these, and with them the images the Clusters
  of a namespace or of the whole cluster may run, a role with any attribute
  PostgreSQL has (`superuser`, `bypassrls`, `replication`), and what a
  database publishes or subscribes to. The open point "No capability gate on
  component types" on go-kure/launcher#790 carries it.

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (an image, an extension, a plugin configuration, a target's object).
  - `cnpg-imagecatalog` and `cnpg-clusterimagecatalog` (`ImageCatalogSpec`,
    which the two objects share): `images`, each an `image`, a `major` and
    its `extensions` (a `name`, an `image` volume source with its `reference`
    and `pullPolicy`, the four path lists and `env`), and `componentImages`,
    each a `key` and an `image`.
  - `cnpg-backup` (`BackupSpec`): `cluster`, `target`, `method`,
    `pluginConfiguration` (`name`, `parameters`), `online` and
    `onlineConfiguration`.
  - `cnpg-scheduledbackup` (`ScheduledBackupSpec`): the six of a Backup, and
    `schedule`, `suspend`, `immediate` and `backupOwnerReference`.
  - `cnpg-databaserole` (`DatabaseRoleSpec`): `cluster`,
    `databaseRoleReclaimPolicy`, `clientCertificate`, and the fields of the
    role configuration the type embeds: `name`, `comment`, `ensure`,
    `passwordSecret`, `disablePassword`, `connectionLimit`, `validUntil`,
    `inRoles`, `inherit`, `superuser`, `createdb`, `createrole`, `login`,
    `replication` and `bypassrls`.
  - `cnpg-publication` (`PublicationSpec`): `cluster`, `name`, `dbname`,
    `parameters`, `target` (`allTables`, or `objects`, each a
    `tablesInSchema` or a `table` with its `name`, `schema`, `only` and
    `columns`) and `publicationReclaimPolicy`.
  - `cnpg-subscription` (`SubscriptionSpec`): `cluster`, `name`, `dbname`,
    `parameters`, `publicationName`, `publicationDBName`,
    `externalClusterName` and `subscriptionReclaimPolicy`.
  - **No default is filled.** An unauthored `method`, `ensure`, `inherit`,
    `backupOwnerReference` or reclaim policy is left out and the API server
    fills its own.
  - **A role's `connectionLimit: 0` is refused** (`connectionLimit: 0 cannot
    be carried by the CloudNativePG API types`): the field is no pointer and
    is omitted when zero, and the CRD's default, `-1` (no limit), would apply
    in its place, so a role authored to accept no connection would accept
    any number.
  - **An empty string is refused on the seven string fields the CRDs
    default** (`method: "" cannot be carried by the CloudNativePG API types
    (the field is omitted when zero, so the operator would apply its default
    "barmanObjectStore")`): `method` on a Backup and a ScheduledBackup
    (`barmanObjectStore`), a ScheduledBackup's `backupOwnerReference`
    (`none`), a role's `ensure` (`present`) and `databaseRoleReclaimPolicy`
    (`retain`), and `publicationReclaimPolicy` and
    `subscriptionReclaimPolicy` (`retain`). The type omits an empty string,
    so the default would replace the authored value. With `connectionLimit`
    these are every such field of the seven specs;
    `TestCnpgKindsDefaultedZeroFields_MatchCRD` derives each kind's list from
    the linked CRDs and fails on another.
  - **A role's `validUntil` is written in UTC.** The API type holds an
    instant: `2030-01-01T02:00:00+02:00` is written
    `2030-01-01T00:00:00Z`. It writes the instant to the second and the zero
    time as null, which the API server drops, so a `validUntil` with a
    fraction of a second other than zero is refused
    (`validUntil "2030-01-01T00:00:00.5Z": a fraction of a second cannot be
    carried by the CloudNativePG API types`), after a period or a comma, read
    from the authored string, since the decode keeps only nine digits of a
    fraction; and so is
    `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` (`validUntil: the zero time cannot be carried by
    the CloudNativePG API types`), which would leave a password that never
    expires. The time as the API type writes it is held to the CRD's
    `date-time` format and to the decoded instant, so an instant outside the
    four-digit years in UTC is refused whatever its authored offset:
    `9999-12-31T23:00:00-02:00` (`validUntil: the CloudNativePG API types
    write it as 10000-01-01T01:00:00Z, which the DatabaseRole CRD's date-time
    format refuses`).

  **Required** follows the rule of the other kinds built on `policyFreeKind`:
  a field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or not it was
  authored. Each must be authored (`images[1].major: required (…)`):
  - a catalog's `images`; an image's `image` and `major`; an extension's
    `name`, and the `name` and the `value` of each of its `env` entries; a
    component image's `key` and `image`;
  - `cluster`, on the five kinds that refer to a Cluster, and its `name` on a
    `cnpg-backup` and a `cnpg-scheduledbackup`. The DatabaseRole,
    Publication and Subscription CRDs default the `name` to an empty string,
    which no Cluster has, so the other three refuse a reference with no name
    on launcher's own account, with the same `cluster.name: required`;
  - a plugin configuration's `name`, on a `cnpg-backup` and a
    `cnpg-scheduledbackup` that author one;
  - a `cnpg-scheduledbackup`'s `schedule`;
  - a `cnpg-databaserole`'s `name`, and the `name` of an authored
    `passwordSecret`;
  - a `cnpg-publication`'s `name`, `dbname` and `target`, and the `name` of a
    target's `table`;
  - a `cnpg-subscription`'s `name`, `dbname`, `publicationName` and
    `externalClusterName`.

  `TestCnpgFurtherKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds these lists to the fields the
  linked module's CRD requires and the type writes unauthored, so a
  dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails there. An authored
  empty value satisfies the rule and is the API server's to refuse
  (`schedule: ""`), with three exceptions the build refuses itself: a
  `cluster.name` must be a name CloudNativePG admits for a Cluster (a DNS-1035
  label of at most 50 characters), as on `cnpg-pooler` and `cnpg-database`;
  a role's `name: ""` breaks a rule of its CRD (below); and a catalog's
  `image: ""`, on an image or a component image, is no image reference and is
  refused by the tag rule (below).

  **The CRDs' expression rules.** The seven CRDs declare 26. The build checks
  the 15 that read one document, each a comparison of authored fields with
  each other or with a string the CRD itself states, so a document that
  breaks one could never be admitted:
  - a catalog (two rules, on each of the two CRDs): no two images of one
    `major` (`images[1].major: 17 is also the major version of images[0]; the
    API takes each major version once`), and no two component images of one
    `key`. The component images are a list keyed on `key`, so the API server
    refuses a key held twice by its schema as well as by the rule;
  - a role (eight): a `name` that is empty, `postgres` or
    `streaming_replica`, or that starts with `pg_` or `cnpg_` (`name
    "postgres": reserved, the DatabaseRole CRD refuses it`); `ensure:
    absent`, which the API does not take on a DatabaseRole (a role is removed
    by deleting the object with `databaseRoleReclaimPolicy: delete`);
    `passwordSecret` beside `disablePassword: true`; and a client certificate
    that is enabled without `login: true`. A certificate is enabled where its
    block is authored and `enabled` is not `false`: the API fills `true` into
    an omitted one before it evaluates the rule. It fills nothing into
    `login`, which the rule reads without asking whether it is there: an
    enabled certificate with no `login` authored is refused by the API server
    as a rule it cannot evaluate (`no such key: login`), and one beside
    `login: false` by the rule's own message. The build gives both the one
    refusal;
  - a publication (three): a `target` that publishes neither or both of
    `allTables: true` and `objects` (`target: one of allTables: true and
    objects is required`); an object that is neither or both of
    `tablesInSchema` and `table`; and a table that lists its `columns` where
    another object publishes `tablesInSchema`. The Go type leaves out a false
    `allTables` and an empty `objects`, `tablesInSchema` or `columns`, so
    each is read as the object will hold it: `allTables: false` beside a list
    of objects builds, and is a list of objects. The API server reads the
    document it is sent, so the two differ on a document that authors one of
    the four, and agree on the object: sent as authored, `allTables: false`
    beside a list of objects is refused, and the object the build writes for
    it is accepted; `allTables: false` alone is accepted as authored and
    refused by the build, since the object written holds neither.
    `TestCnpgPublication_TargetAsWritten` shows the first for each of the
    four, and the second for the three that can stand alone (an empty
    `columns` alone is a table that lists none).

  The other eleven refuse a change of the stored object, which a build does
  not have, and stay the API server's: a Backup's whole `spec`; the `cluster`
  of a ScheduledBackup, a DatabaseRole, a Publication and a Subscription; the
  `name` of a role; the `name` and the `dbname` of a publication and of a
  subscription; and a publication's `target.allTables`, from one authored
  value to another. Such a change builds here and is refused at apply, until
  the object is deleted and created again. The rule on `allTables` sits on
  that optional field, and the API server does not evaluate it where the
  field is absent from the stored object or from the new one: a target moved
  from `allTables` to `objects`, or back, is not refused by it.
  `TestCnpgFurtherKinds_ExpressionRules` lists all 26 with what is
  done with each, and fails on a rule that is added, dropped or reworded. It
  holds each of the 15 to the API server's own expression validator, run
  over the linked CRD after the defaults the API server fills: with every
  other rule set aside, the validator refuses the properties that break the
  rule, and with every rule it accepts the ones next to them and the object
  the build writes for them; the build answers the same on both.

  **A Backup is a one-shot request.** The operator takes the backup once,
  when the object is created, and the API refuses every later change of its
  `spec`. A `cnpg-backup` kept in a repository and applied again is the same
  object: nothing runs, and a change to its properties is refused at apply.
  Where the repository is applied continuously, the API refuses the changed
  document at every apply, so the delivery fails on it each time until the
  change is taken back, or the request is authored as a new object (another
  `objectName`), which is a new Backup and a new backup taken. What a
  delivery tool set to replace an object it cannot update does with that
  refusal is the tool's, and is not read here.
  It suits a backup that is asked for once, under a name of its own (before
  an upgrade, say), and is then left as the record of that backup. A backup
  that recurs is a `cnpg-scheduledbackup`, whose Backups the operator creates
  and names.

  **Not checked**, and the API server's or the operator's to refuse:
  - the number of a catalog's images (one to eight) and of its component
    images (at most 32), a `major` below 10, and the forms of a `key`, of an
    extension's `name` and of an `env` name;
  - a `schedule`: launcher does not parse it. The operator reads a cron
    expression of six fields, the first of which is the seconds; its webhook
    refuses a schedule that does not parse and only warns of one that parses
    with another number of fields;
  - what the operator's webhook holds a Backup and a ScheduledBackup to: that
    `online` and `onlineConfiguration` do not come with the
    `barmanObjectStore` method, which is also the method of a document that
    authors none, and, on a Backup only, that the `plugin` method comes with
    a `pluginConfiguration`;
  - `parameters` on a publication, a subscription and a plugin configuration:
    a free map of strings, written as authored;
  - every other value rule of the API: the enumerations (`method`, `target`,
    `backupOwnerReference`, `ensure`, the reclaim policies, an image volume's
    `pullPolicy`). A `validUntil` is the exception: the strict decode reads
    an RFC 3339 time and refuses anything else.

  **The tag rule on a catalog's images.** The three fields of a catalog that
  name an image are held to `ValidateImageRef`, as a container's image is,
  when the component is read, with or without a policy: an image's `image`, a
  component image's `image` and the `reference` of an extension's image
  volume. One without a tag or digest, or tagged `:latest` (with a digest
  too), or one that is no image reference, is refused by the field's path
  (`images[0].image: image "registry.example/team/postgresql" rejected: no tag
  or digest specified; use an explicit version tag or digest`), and the
  refusal carries no policy class: a Cluster that takes its image from the
  catalog runs what the entry names. An extension that names no reference
  names no image and is not checked. A reference by digest alone passes; what
  CloudNativePG itself requires of a catalog's image is the operator's rule
  and is left to it. The rule runs at that read and nowhere else: generation
  builds the object from what the read decoded and does not repeat it.
  `cnpg-cluster` and `cnpg-pooler` repeat theirs at generation because their
  config is an exported value a caller can change after the read; nothing but
  the read can make a catalog's config.
  `TestImageTagRule_CnpgImageCatalogs` holds the three, on both kinds.

  **Policy.** The two catalogs are held to the environment policy; the other
  five have no field an `oam.Policy` method speaks to, and build the same
  under every policy and under none.
  - **Every image a catalog names is held to the allowed registries.** A
    catalog runs no pod, but an image a Cluster takes from it is one the
    operator runs. `ApplyPolicy` checks the three fields that name one, and
    refuses by the field's path with the class `oam.RefusalRegistry`: an
    image's `image`
    (`images[0].image`), a component image's `image`
    (`componentImages[0].image`) and the `reference` of an extension's image
    volume (`images[0].extensions[0].image.reference`). An extension that
    names no reference names no image, and nothing is checked for it.
    `TestCnpgImageCatalogs_ImagesAreHeldToTheAllowedRegistries` holds the
    three, on both kinds.
  - **A Cluster's reference to a catalog is a name.** A `cnpg-cluster`'s
    `imageCatalogRef` names a catalog and a major version, and holds no
    image: the host is read where the image is authored, on the catalog. A
    catalog that is not built with launcher is not seen.
  - **No field holds a literal secret.** A role's `passwordSecret` is the
    name of a Secret in the role's namespace, and launcher emits no Secret
    for it; a subscription's credentials are those of the external cluster
    the subscriber Cluster defines. A plugin's `parameters` and an
    extension's `env` are free text: a value written there is written into
    the object as authored and is not checked.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties,
  and the object also carries the component label (see "Component label and
  ownership" in the OAM model).

  **Not covered.** Whether what is referred to exists: the Cluster, the
  Secret, the database, the publication, the external cluster of a
  subscription, the plugin, the schema and the tables a publication names. A
  status of any of the seven is the operator's and is not written. The
  Backups a ScheduledBackup creates, and the Secret a role's client
  certificate is issued into (`<object name>-client-cert`), are the
  operator's too.
- **metallb-bfdprofile** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection
  of a fourth object of MetalLB's `metallb.io/v1beta1` API: a BFDProfile. It
  is built on `policyFreeKind` as the kinds above are and emits that one
  object, named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the
  handler adds no label, no annotation and no default of its own.

  **What it changes for others.** A profile is the settings of a BFD
  session: the intervals at which control packets are sent and expected
  (`receiveInterval`, `transmitInterval`, `echoInterval`, in milliseconds),
  the multiplier that turns an interval into the time after which the
  connection to a peer is taken for lost (`detectMultiplier`), the echo and
  passive modes, and the minimum time-to-live of a multi-hop session's
  packets (`minimumTtl`). On its own it changes nothing: a MetalLB BGPPeer
  names the profile its session uses (`bfdProfile`), and a peer that names
  none has no BFD session. The profile then decides how fast the loss of
  that peer is noticed.

  **The object is namespaced, and MetalLB reads it in one namespace only**,
  as it reads a pool: it is written in the build namespace, and a profile of
  an application built for another namespace than the one MetalLB watches is
  an object MetalLB does not read. Launcher does not know that namespace and
  checks nothing of it.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind**: where MetalLB's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component of an application built for MetalLB's
  namespace may author a profile, and may so change the timers of the peers
  that already name one of that name. A policy can keep the kind out of a
  build through the object kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`,
  go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the seven top-level json fields of
  `BFDProfileSpec`, decoded strictly: an unknown key is refused. None is
  required, and a component that authors none builds, as `spec: {}`.
  - **No default is filled, and every authored value is written.** Each
    field is a pointer: an authored `echoMode: false` or `passiveMode: false`
    is written, and so is an authored 0. The CRD declares no default. The
    values MetalLB uses for an unset field are MetalLB's: the comments of its
    type name 300 ms for the receive and the transmit interval and 50 ms for
    the echo interval, which launcher neither fills nor checks.
    `TestMetalLBKinds_NoDefaultIsLost` fails on a default a dependency bump
    adds to a field that could not carry an authored empty value.

  **Required**: nothing. `TestMetalLBKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds that to
  the linked module's `v1beta1` CRD.

  **The CRD's expression rules.** The CRD declares none;
  `TestMetalLBKinds_ExpressionRules` fails on one that is added.

  **Not checked**, and MetalLB's or the API server's to refuse:
  - **MetalLB's validating webhook was not read, and nothing it refuses is
    repeated here.** An object the CRD's schema takes may still be refused at
    apply by the webhook MetalLB installs;
  - the bounds the CRD sets on the numbers (10 to 60000 for an interval, 2 to
    255 for the multiplier, 1 to 254 for the time-to-live): a value outside
    them is written as authored;
  - whether the modes fit the session: the type's comment says the echo mode
    is not supported on multi-hop setups, and `minimumTtl` is for multi-hop
    sessions only.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  A BGPPeer refers to the profile by its name: name the component so, or set
  `objectName`.

  **Policy.** No field of the spec is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to, so
  `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and the kind builds the
  same under every policy and under none. No field names a host or an image,
  and none holds a literal secret or refers to a Secret.

  **Not covered.** Whether a peer names the profile. The object's status is
  MetalLB's and is not written: the type has no field in it, and the YAML
  the library writes leaves an empty status out.
- **metallb-bgpadvertisement** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named
  projection of a third object of MetalLB's `metallb.io/v1beta1` API: a
  BGPAdvertisement. It is built on `policyFreeKind` as the two kinds above
  are and emits that one object, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default of its own.

  **What it changes for others.** A BGPAdvertisement makes MetalLB announce
  to the cluster's BGP peers the addresses it gave to Services from address
  pools, and sets what the routes carry. No field is required:
  - `ipAddressPools` names the pools and `ipAddressPoolSelectors` selects
    them by their labels. With no pool named or selected the advertisement
    applies to every pool MetalLB reads;
  - `peers` limits the BGP peers the addresses are announced to. With none,
    they are announced to every BGP peer MetalLB is configured with;
  - `nodeSelectors` limits the nodes that are announced as next hops for an
    address. With none, the advertisement excludes no node;
  - `serviceSelectors` limits the Services. With none, every Service that
    has an address of the selected pools is announced;
  - `aggregationLength` and `aggregationLengthV6` roll the addresses up into
    a larger prefix, of that length, which is then what is announced in
    place of one route per address;
  - `localPref` and `communities` are attributes of the announcement: BGP's
    best path selection prefers a path with a higher LOCAL_PREF, and the
    communities are attached to what the peers receive.

  **A component that authors no property is the widest advertisement there
  is**: every pool, to every peer, for every Service, and no node excluded.
  It builds, as `spec: {}`.

  **The object is namespaced, and MetalLB reads it in one namespace only**,
  as it reads a pool: it is written in the build namespace, and an
  advertisement of an application built for another namespace than the one
  MetalLB watches is an object MetalLB does not read. Launcher does not know
  that namespace and checks nothing of it.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind**: where MetalLB's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component of an application built for MetalLB's
  namespace may author an advertisement, and with it which addresses the
  cluster announces to its BGP peers and with which attributes. A policy can
  keep the kind out of a build through the object kind policy
  (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of
  `BGPAdvertisementSpec`, decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is
  refused wherever it sits (the spec, a selector, a match expression).
  - **No default is filled, and an authored value is written where the Go
    type can hold it.** The two aggregation lengths are pointers: an authored
    one is written, also where it is the value the API would fill, and an
    unauthored one is left out, which the API fills with 32 and 128, one
    route per address. `TestMetalLBKinds_NoDefaultIsLost` holds the defaults
    of the linked CRD to that.
  - `localPref` is a number the type omits at 0, with no default in the CRD:
    an authored `localPref: 0` is left out, and is the same advertisement to
    MetalLB as one that does not author the field, since its type holds one
    value for both. That is not an advertisement without LOCAL_PREF: what
    MetalLB sends is its BGP backend's choice (at MetalLB v0.16.1 the native
    backend sends LOCAL_PREF 0 on an iBGP session; the FRR backends set no
    local preference). An authored empty list is left out too, as the type
    omits it: it is the same advertisement as one that does not author the
    field.

  **Required**: the `key` and the `operator` of a match expression, in every
  selector of `ipAddressPoolSelectors`, `nodeSelectors` and
  `serviceSelectors`. The API requires nothing else of the spec.
  `TestMetalLBKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the list to the linked module's
  `v1beta1` CRD.

  **The CRD's expression rule is checked.** The CRD declares one, on the
  spec: a service selector is taken only with one route per address. A
  component that authors a non-empty `serviceSelectors` beside an
  `aggregationLength` other than 32 or an `aggregationLengthV6` other than
  128 is refused (`serviceSelectors: not allowed with aggregationLength 24:
  …`). The API server evaluates the rule after it has filled its defaults,
  which are those two values, so an unauthored length keeps the rule, as one
  authored at that value does, and so does an empty list of selectors.
  `TestMetalLBKinds_ExpressionRules` holds the kind's answer to the API
  server's for the linked CRD, on properties that break the rule and on
  properties that keep it, and fails on a rule that is added or reworded.

  **Not checked**, and MetalLB's or the API server's to refuse:
  - **MetalLB's validating webhook was not read, and nothing it refuses is
    repeated here.** An object the CRD's schema takes may still be refused at
    apply by the webhook MetalLB installs;
  - the CRD's other value rules: an `aggregationLength` below 1 is written
    as authored;
  - a community: no entry of `communities` is read, neither its form nor
    whether a Community object defines the alias it names;
  - a pool's name and a peer's name: one that names no object of the
    application builds;
  - an authored empty value in a required field (a `key: ""`). It is a value.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  The pools `ipAddressPools` names are the object names of
  `metallb-ipaddresspool` components (the component's name, or its
  `objectName`), and the labels `ipAddressPoolSelectors` queries are their
  `labels`. The other two selectors query objects launcher does not write
  the labels of here (nodes, Services) and are the author's.

  **Policy.** No field of the spec is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to, so
  `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and the kind builds the
  same under every policy and under none. No field names a host or an image,
  and none holds a literal secret or refers to a Secret.

  **Not covered.** Whether what is named or selected exists (a pool, a peer,
  a community alias, a node, a Service). The object's status is MetalLB's
  and is not written: the type has no field in it, and the YAML the library
  writes leaves an empty status out.
- **metallb-bgppeer** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of
  a sixth object of MetalLB's API: a BGPPeer. It is built at
  `metallb.io/v1beta2`, not at the `v1beta1` of the five kinds above: that is
  the version the linked module's CRD stores, `v1beta1` is served and marked
  deprecated there, and the base library's constructor builds the peer at
  `v1beta2`. `TestMetalLBKinds_EmitTheServedVersion` holds each kind to the
  version its CRD serves and stores. The kind is built on `policyHeldKind`, the helper of
  the kinds above with one check under the environment policy, and emits that
  one object, named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the
  handler adds no label, no annotation and no default of its own.

  **What it changes for others.** A BGPPeer is a router MetalLB holds a BGP
  session with, from the nodes that match one of the `nodeSelectors`, and
  from every node where the list is unset or empty; selectors that match no
  node leave the peer with no session. Over that session the cluster announces the
  addresses its BGP advertisements cover: an advertisement that names no peer
  announces to every peer, so a new peer receives those announcements without
  any advertisement being changed. The fields say who the peer is and how the
  session runs:
  - `myASN` is the AS number of the cluster's end, `peerASN` the one expected
    of the router, or `dynamicASN` (`internal` or `external`) where it is
    detected; `localASN` announces another AS number to this peer;
  - `peerAddress` is the address dialled, or `interface` the node's interface
    of an unnumbered session; `peerPort`, `sourceAddress`, `routerID` and
    `vrf` are the rest of the connection;
  - `holdTime`, `keepaliveTime` and `connectTime` are the session's timers;
  - `password` or `passwordSecret` authenticates the session (TCP MD5);
  - `bfdProfile` names the BFDProfile of the session's BFD session, and a
    peer that names none has no BFD session;
  - `enableGracefulRestart`, `ebgpMultiHop`, `disableMP` (deprecated upstream
    in favour of `dualStackAddressFamily`) and `dualStackAddressFamily` are
    switches of the session.

  **The object is namespaced, and MetalLB reads it in one namespace only**,
  as it reads a pool: it is written in the build namespace, and a peer of an
  application built for another namespace than the one MetalLB watches is an
  object MetalLB does not read. Launcher does not know that namespace and
  checks nothing of it.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind**: where MetalLB's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component of an application built for MetalLB's
  namespace may author a peer, and with it a router that the cluster's nodes
  connect to and that is told the addresses of the cluster's Services. A
  policy can keep the kind out of a build through the object kind policy
  (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the twenty-one top-level json fields of
  `BGPPeerSpec`, decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused
  wherever it sits (the spec, the Secret reference, a selector, a match
  expression).
  - **No default is filled.** The CRD declares three. `disableMP` and
    `dualStackAddressFamily` default to `false`, which is the value the type
    leaves out: an authored `false` is left out, and the API fills the same
    `false` back. `peerPort` defaults to 179 and the type leaves a 0 out, so
    an authored `peerPort: 0` would become 179: it is refused (`peerPort: 0
    cannot be carried by the MetalLB API types (…)`). An unauthored port is
    left out, and the API fills 179. `TestMetalLBKinds_NoDefaultIsLost` holds
    the kind's list of such fields to the linked CRD.
  - **An authored 0, false or empty string on any other field the type omits
    when empty is left out**, as the type holds one value for it and for a
    peer that does not author the field: `peerASN`, `localASN`, the two other
    switches, the addresses and names. For `localASN` that is a value under
    the CRD's minimum of 1, which the API server therefore does not see.
  - The three timers are pointers: an authored `holdTime: 0s` is written. A
    duration is written in the form the type gives it (`90s` as `1m30s`).
  - `myASN` is always encoded: an authored 0 is written.
  - **`passwordSecret: {}` is written where no reference is authored.** The
    type holds the reference by value and always encodes it. The CRD takes
    it, and MetalLB v0.16.1 reads a reference with no name as none.

  **Required**: `myASN`, and the `key` and the `operator` of a match
  expression in every selector of `nodeSelectors`. The API requires nothing
  else of the spec. `TestMetalLBKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the list to the
  linked module's `v1beta2` CRD.

  **Two of the CRD's three expression rules are checked.** Both are on
  `connectTime`: it is from 1 to 65535 seconds, and it is a whole number of
  seconds. A `connectTime` that breaks one is refused (`connectTime: 1.5s is
  not a whole number of seconds, which the API requires`). The kind reads a
  duration as the API server's rules do, in whole seconds and whole
  milliseconds with the rest dropped: `65535.5s` passes the first rule and
  breaks the second, and a part smaller than a millisecond is seen by
  neither, here or there. `TestMetalLBKinds_ExpressionRules` holds the kind's
  answer to the API server's for the linked CRD, on properties that break
  each rule and on properties that keep it, and fails on a rule that is added
  or reworded. **The third rule is left**: `enableGracefulRestart` may not
  change after creation. It compares the field with the stored object's,
  which a build does not have, and the API server does not evaluate it on a
  create.

  **Not checked**, and MetalLB's or the API server's to refuse:
  - **MetalLB's validating webhook was not read, and nothing it refuses is
    repeated here.** An object the CRD's schema takes may still be refused at
    apply by the webhook MetalLB installs;
  - what MetalLB itself requires of a peer when it reads its configuration.
    At v0.16.1 that is, among others: a `myASN` other than 0; exactly one of
    `peerASN` and `dynamicASN`; exactly one of `peerAddress` and `interface`;
    not both `password` and a named `passwordSecret`. A component that breaks
    one of these builds;
  - the CRD's other value rules: a `peerPort` above 16384 and a `dynamicASN`
    that is neither `internal` nor `external` are written as authored;
  - an address, a router ID and a VRF's or an interface's name: none is read;
  - the profile `bfdProfile` names and the Secret `passwordSecret` names:
    one that names no object of the application builds;
  - an authored empty value in a required field (a `key: ""`). It is a value.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  A BGPAdvertisement names the peers it announces to (`peers`): name the
  component so, or set `objectName`. The profile `bfdProfile` names is the
  object name of a `metallb-bfdprofile` component (the component's name, or
  its `objectName`). `nodeSelectors` queries nodes, whose labels launcher
  does not write, and is the author's.

  **Policy.** The environment policy reaches one field.
  - **`password` is the session's password in the clear, and is refused under
    a policy that forbids explicit secrets** (`password: holds the BGP session
    password in the object, and the environment policy forbids explicit
    secrets; name a Secret created out of band in passwordSecret instead`), as
    the keystore password of a `certificate` is. The refusal does not carry
    the value. Under a policy that allows explicit secrets, under one that
    does not answer the question and under none the peer builds, with the
    password in the object as authored. An empty `password` is none.
    `TestMetalLBBGPPeerKind_SessionPassword` holds this.
  - **`passwordSecret` names a Secret and holds no secret**, and builds under
    every policy. Launcher does not create that Secret and does not check
    that it exists. The upstream type's comment asks for one of type
    `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`, in the namespace of the MetalLB deployment, with the
    password under the key `password`; none of that is checked, and neither
    is the reference's `namespace`.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** The addresses a peer holds are a network's,
    not an artifact source, and none is held to the policy's allowed
    registries. No field names an image.
  - No other `oam.Policy` method speaks to a field of the spec, and
    `ApplyPolicy` fills nothing.

  **Not covered.** Whether what is named or selected exists (a profile, a
  Secret, a node), and whether the router is reachable. The object's status
  is MetalLB's and is not written: the type has no field in it, and the YAML
  the library writes leaves an empty status out.
- **metallb-community** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection
  of a fifth object of MetalLB's `metallb.io/v1beta1` API: a Community. It is
  built on `policyFreeKind` as the kinds above are and emits that one object,
  named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds
  no label, no annotation and no default of its own.

  **What it changes for others.** A Community defines aliases: each gives a
  `name` to one BGP community `value`, a standard one of the form
  `1234:1234` or a large one of the form `large:1234:1234:1234`. On its own
  it announces nothing. An item of a MetalLB BGPAdvertisement's
  `communities` may be the name of such an alias, and the advertisement then
  attaches the alias's value to what the cluster announces to its BGP peers.
  Routers that receive a route may act on its communities, so the value
  behind a name bears on how the networks beyond the cluster treat the
  addresses announced under it.

  **The object is namespaced, and MetalLB reads it in one namespace only**,
  as it reads a pool: it is written in the build namespace, and a Community
  of an application built for another namespace than the one MetalLB watches
  is an object MetalLB does not read. Launcher does not know that namespace
  and checks nothing of it.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind**: where MetalLB's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component of an application built for MetalLB's
  namespace may author a Community, and may so define a name an
  advertisement there already uses. What MetalLB does with a name that two
  aliases define, in one object or in two, was not read. A policy can keep
  the kind out of a build through the object kind policy
  (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The one property is the top-level json field of
  `CommunitySpec`, `communities`, decoded strictly: an unknown key is
  refused, in the spec and in an alias. It is not required, and a component
  that authors none builds, as `spec: {}`.
  - **No default is filled.** The CRD declares none. The `name` and the
    `value` of an alias are strings the upstream type leaves out when empty,
    and the CRD requires neither: an alias authored with an empty one is
    written without it, and an alias that authors nothing is written as an
    empty item. `TestMetalLBKinds_NoDefaultIsLost` fails on a default a
    dependency bump adds to a field that could not carry an authored empty
    value.

  **Required**: nothing. `TestMetalLBKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds that to
  the linked module's `v1beta1` CRD.

  **The CRD's expression rules.** The CRD declares none;
  `TestMetalLBKinds_ExpressionRules` fails on one that is added.

  **Not checked**, and MetalLB's or the API server's to refuse:
  - **MetalLB's validating webhook was not read, and nothing it refuses is
    repeated here.** An object the CRD's schema takes may still be refused at
    apply by the webhook MetalLB installs;
  - the form of a value: one that is neither a standard nor a large
    community is written as authored;
  - an alias without a name or without a value, and a name defined twice.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  An advertisement refers to an alias by the alias's `name`, not by the name
  of the object that holds it.

  **Policy.** No field of the spec is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to, so
  `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and the kind builds the
  same under every policy and under none. No field names a host or an image,
  and none holds a literal secret or refers to a Secret.

  **Not covered.** Whether an advertisement names an alias, and whether a name
  an advertisement uses is defined. The object's status is MetalLB's and is
  not written: the type has no field in it, and the YAML the library writes
  leaves an empty status out.
- **metallb-ipaddresspool** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named
  projection of an object of MetalLB's `metallb.io/v1beta1` API: an
  IPAddressPool. It is built on `policyFreeKind` and emits that one object,
  named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds no
  label, no annotation and no default of its own. The type name carries the
  `metallb-` prefix as the kinds of Cilium's API carry theirs: both APIs have
  a pool of addresses and an advertisement for BGP.

  **What it changes for others.** A pool is the address ranges MetalLB has
  authority over and gives to Services of type LoadBalancer. With no
  `serviceAllocation` the pool is limited to no namespace and no Service: a
  Service of any namespace of the cluster may be given one of its addresses.
  `serviceAllocation` limits it to the namespaces it lists or selects and to
  the Services it selects. `autoAssign: false` keeps MetalLB from allocating
  from the pool on its own.

  **The object is namespaced, and MetalLB reads it in one namespace only.** It
  is written in the build namespace. MetalLB reads the objects of its API in
  one namespace and in no other: the one it is configured to watch, by its
  `--namespace` flag or the `METALLB_NAMESPACE` variable, and by default the
  one it runs in. A pool of an application built for another namespace is an
  object MetalLB does not read. Launcher does not know that namespace and
  checks nothing of it.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind**: where MetalLB's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component of an application built for MetalLB's
  namespace may author a pool, and with it which Services of the cluster get
  an address of which range. A policy can keep the kind out of a build
  through the object kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`,
  go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of
  `IPAddressPoolSpec`, decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is
  refused wherever it sits (the spec, the allocation, a selector).
  - `addresses`, each a CIDR prefix or a first and a last address joined by a
    dash; `autoAssign`; `avoidBuggyIPs`; `serviceAllocation`, with its
    `priority`, `namespaces`, `namespaceSelectors` and `serviceSelectors`.
  - **No default is filled, and an authored value that is the API's default is
    not written where the Go type cannot hold it.** `autoAssign` is a pointer:
    an authored `false` is written, and an unauthored one is left out, which
    the API fills with `true`. `avoidBuggyIPs` is no pointer and is omitted
    when false: an authored `false` is left out of the object, and the API
    fills the same `false` back. `TestMetalLBKinds_NoDefaultIsLost` holds the
    defaults of the linked CRD to that: one that is not the field's empty
    value, on a field that is no pointer, fails there. An allocation's
    `priority` is a number the type omits at 0, with no default in the CRD:
    an authored `priority: 0` is an allocation with no priority, as MetalLB's
    own type reads it.

  **Required**: a field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or
  not it was authored must be authored (`addresses: required (…)`):
  - `addresses`;
  - the `key` and the `operator` of a match expression, in every selector of
    `serviceAllocation.namespaceSelectors` and
    `serviceAllocation.serviceSelectors`.

  An authored empty value satisfies the rule: `addresses: []` is a pool with
  no address, which the CRD's schema takes. `TestMetalLBKinds_RequiredMatchCRD`
  holds the list to the fields the linked module's `v1beta1` CRD requires and
  the type writes unauthored, so a dependency bump that adds, drops or moves
  one fails there.

  **The CRD's expression rules.** The CRD declares none;
  `TestMetalLBKinds_ExpressionRules` fails on one that is added.

  **Not checked**, and MetalLB's or the API server's to refuse:
  - **MetalLB's validating webhook was not read, and nothing it refuses is
    repeated here.** An object the CRD's schema takes may still be refused at
    apply by the webhook MetalLB installs;
  - an address: no entry of `addresses` is read, and a string that is no
    range builds;
  - an authored empty value in a required field (a `key: ""`). It is a value.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  **A pool is referred to by its name, or selected by its labels.** A MetalLB
  advertisement names the pools it announces (`ipAddressPools`): name the
  component so, or set `objectName`. Its `ipAddressPoolSelectors` is a label
  query over pools: write the labels it names under the `labels` of the
  `metallb-ipaddresspool`. The object also carries the component label, whose
  value is the component's (see "Component label and ownership" in the OAM
  model). The selectors of `serviceAllocation` query objects launcher does
  not write the labels of here (namespaces, Services) and are the author's.

  **Policy.** No field of the spec is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to, so
  `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and the kind builds the
  same under every policy and under none.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** No field names a host. An address or a range a
    pool holds is a network's, not an artifact source, and none is held to
    the policy's allowed registries.
  - **No field holds a literal secret or refers to a Secret, and none is
    checked.**

  **Not covered.** Whether what is selected exists (a namespace, a Service).
  The pool's status is MetalLB's and is not written: the Go type always
  encodes its four counters, at zero, and the YAML the library writes leaves
  a status that holds nothing else out.
- **metallb-l2advertisement** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named
  projection of another object of MetalLB's `metallb.io/v1beta1` API: an
  L2Advertisement. It is built on `policyFreeKind` as `metallb-ipaddresspool`
  is and emits that one object, named after the component unless `objectName`
  names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no default of its
  own.

  **What it changes for others.** An L2Advertisement makes MetalLB announce
  on the local network (layer 2) the addresses it gave to Services from
  address pools. Every field narrows it, and none is required:
  - `ipAddressPools` names the pools and `ipAddressPoolSelectors` selects
    them by their labels. With no pool named or selected the advertisement
    applies to every pool MetalLB reads;
  - `nodeSelectors` limits the nodes that are announced as next hops for an
    address. With none, the advertisement excludes no node;
  - `interfaces` lists the interfaces of a node the address is announced
    from. With none, it is announced from all of them;
  - `serviceSelectors` limits the Services. With none, every Service that
    has an address of the selected pools is announced.

  **A component that authors no property is the widest advertisement there
  is**: every pool, every interface, every Service, and no node excluded. It
  builds, as `spec: {}`.

  **The object is namespaced, and MetalLB reads it in one namespace only**,
  as it reads a pool: it is written in the build namespace, and an
  advertisement of an application built for another namespace than the one
  MetalLB watches is an object MetalLB does not read. Launcher does not know
  that namespace and checks nothing of it.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind**: where MetalLB's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component of an application built for MetalLB's
  namespace may author an advertisement, and with it which addresses the
  cluster announces on its local network, from which nodes and interfaces.
  A policy can keep the kind out of a build through the object kind policy
  (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of
  `L2AdvertisementSpec`, decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is
  refused wherever it sits (the spec, a selector, a match expression). The
  CRD declares no default on any of them, and none is filled. An authored
  empty list is left out, as the type omits it: it is the same advertisement
  as one that does not author the field.

  **Required**: the `key` and the `operator` of a match expression, in every
  selector of `ipAddressPoolSelectors`, `nodeSelectors` and
  `serviceSelectors` (`nodeSelectors[1].matchExpressions[0].key: required
  (…)`). The API requires nothing else of the spec.
  `TestMetalLBKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the list to the linked module's
  `v1beta1` CRD.

  **The CRD's expression rules.** The CRD declares none;
  `TestMetalLBKinds_ExpressionRules` fails on one that is added.

  **Not checked**, and MetalLB's or the API server's to refuse:
  - **MetalLB's validating webhook was not read, and nothing it refuses is
    repeated here.** An object the CRD's schema takes may still be refused at
    apply by the webhook MetalLB installs;
  - a pool's name: no entry of `ipAddressPools` is read, and one that names
    no pool of the application builds;
  - an interface's name;
  - an authored empty value in a required field (a `key: ""`). It is a value.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  The pools `ipAddressPools` names are the object names of
  `metallb-ipaddresspool` components (the component's name, or its
  `objectName`), and the labels `ipAddressPoolSelectors` queries are their
  `labels`. The other two selectors query objects launcher does not write
  the labels of here (nodes, Services) and are the author's.

  **Policy.** No field of the spec is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to, so
  `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and the kind builds the
  same under every policy and under none. No field names a host or an image,
  and none holds a literal secret or refers to a Secret.

  **Not covered.** Whether what is named or selected exists (a pool, a node,
  an interface, a Service). The object's status is MetalLB's and is not
  written: the type has no field in it, and the YAML the library writes
  leaves an empty status out.

- **alertmanager** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of an
  Alertmanager of the Prometheus operator's `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` API. It
  is built on `policyHeldKind` (`policyFreeKind` with a policy check, see
  **storageclass**, below) and emits that one object in the build namespace,
  named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds no
  label, no annotation and no default, and declares the object as namespaced. Launcher
  emits no pod, no StatefulSet, no Service and no Secret for it: the operator
  builds a StatefulSet from the object and runs the pods. What the spec says
  of those pods is held to the environment policy as a workload kind's own
  fields are.

  **No capability is required, and none gates the kind.** As for the four
  kinds under **servicemonitor**, below, launcher does not ask
  whether the cluster serves `monitoring.coreos.com/v1`: where the operator's
  CRDs are not installed the
  component builds, and the object is refused at apply. Whoever may author a
  component may author an Alertmanager, and so make the operator run pods in
  the namespace; the policy below is what holds them. A policy can keep the
  kind out of a build through the object kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`,
  go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of
  `AlertmanagerSpec`, decoded strictly at every depth (an unknown key is
  refused wherever it sits: a container, a claim template, a web setting),
  less the three under "Not authorable":
  - the image: `image`, `version`, `imagePullPolicy`, `imagePullSecrets`;
  - the pods: `replicas`, `resources`, `storage`, `volumes`, `volumeMounts`,
    `containers`, `initContainers`, `securityContext`, `podMetadata`, where
    they are scheduled (`nodeSelector`, `affinity`, `tolerations`,
    `topologySpreadConstraints`, `schedulerName`, `priorityClassName`) and
    their settings (`serviceAccountName`, `automountServiceAccountToken`,
    `hostNetwork`, `hostUsers`, `hostAliases`, `dnsPolicy`, `dnsConfig`,
    `enableServiceLinks`, `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`);
  - the StatefulSet: `serviceName`, `podManagementPolicy`, `updateStrategy`,
    `minReadySeconds`, `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy`;
  - Alertmanager itself: `configSecret`, `alertmanagerConfiguration`,
    `alertmanagerConfigSelector`, `alertmanagerConfigNamespaceSelector`,
    `alertmanagerConfigMatcherStrategy`, `secrets`, `configMaps`,
    `retention`, `logLevel`, `logFormat`, `externalUrl`, `routePrefix`,
    `listenLocal`, `portName`, `web`, `limits`, `enableFeatures`,
    `additionalArgs`, `paused`;
  - its cluster: `additionalPeers`, `clusterAdvertiseAddress`,
    `clusterGossipInterval`, `clusterLabel`, `clusterPushpullInterval`,
    `clusterPeerTimeout`, `clusterPeerName`, `clusterTLS`,
    `forceEnableClusterMode`.

  The type's comments say that an entry sharing its name with a container the
  operator generates is merged into it. For an Alertmanager the operator
  generates `alertmanager` and `config-reloader` under `containers`, and
  `init-config-reloader` under `initContainers` (`makeStatefulSetSpec` in
  `pkg/alertmanager/statefulset.go` of prometheus-operator v0.94.1, the
  version the linked module is cut from); it generates no `thanos-sidecar`,
  so an entry of that name is a container of its own. Of the three, only
  `alertmanager` takes its image from the spec; the two reloaders run the
  image of the operator's own configuration unless an entry patches them.
  Launcher holds every entry the same way, patch or not. `additionalArgs` is
  passed to the alertmanager container as written; only an argument's name is
  read, to refuse one that names a flag the operator generates (below). An
  argument can still change what the other fields configure.

  **Not authorable: `baseImage`, `tag` and `sha`.** Each is refused when not
  empty, beside an `image` too, with or without a policy (`tag: not
  authorable: the Prometheus operator deprecates the field, and composes the
  image it yields outside what the object states; use image`). The three are
  deprecated upstream, and the image they yield is composed in operator code
  outside the linked module, so the kind cannot say which image runs and has
  nothing to hold to the allowed registries or the tag rule. They are not in
  the schema, so a caller that validates the properties against it first, as
  `kurel build` does, refuses each as an unsupported field whatever its value,
  an empty one included. A caller that converts the component without that
  validation gets the text above, and there an authored empty string is the
  object an absent one is, and builds.

  **Required** follows the rule of those four kinds: a field the API
  requires that the Go type writes whether or not it was authored. No
  top-level field is one. Of what is authored below them
  (`clusterTLS.server: required (…)`, `hostAliases[1].hostnames: required
  (…)`):
  - an additional argument's `name`, a DNS option's `name`, a host alias's
    `ip` and `hostnames`;
  - the `server` and the `client` of a `clusterTLS`;
  - the `type` of an `updateStrategy`;
  - under `alertmanagerConfiguration.global`: the `host` and the `port` of
    `smtp.smartHost`, and the `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `tokenUrl` of
    `httpConfig.oauth2`;
  - the `key` and `operator` of a match expression, in every label selector
    the spec holds (`affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].labelSelector.matchExpressions[0].operator:
    required (…)`; the selectors are listed under "A label selector's match
    expressions"). Presence only, as on the monitors.

  `TestMonitoringKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers` holds the list to the markers of
  the linked module's source. The module ships no CRD, so there is no schema
  to hold it to, and what the API server requires beyond the markers is not
  known here. **Not refused:** a required field of a Kubernetes type the spec
  embeds (a container's `name`, the `key` of a Secret key reference), which is
  emitted empty; and two fields of a listed container or init container and
  two of a listed volume that upstream marks required and the type leaves out
  when empty (the `action` of a container restart rule and the `operator` of
  its exit codes, the `signerName` and `keyType` of a pod certificate
  source), as on the **pod** kind.

  **An authored `0` or `""` the type cannot carry is refused.** As on the pod
  kinds, on a listed container, init container or volume: a
  `timeoutSeconds`, `periodSeconds`, `successThreshold` or `failureThreshold`
  written as `0` on a liveness, readiness or startup probe
  (`containers[0].readinessProbe.periodSeconds: 0 cannot be carried by the
  Prometheus operator API types (…)`); an empty string the API server
  defaults, such as a container's `imagePullPolicy`, a port's `protocol`, an
  `httpGet` `path` or `scheme`, or a volume source's default; and, under
  `hostNetwork: true`, a port's `hostPort` written as `0`, which the API
  server would set to the port's `containerPort`. The refusal holds for an
  entry that patches one of the operator's own containers too: the zero is
  left out there as anywhere, and what then applies is the operator's value
  for that container, not the authored one. As on the other kinds of the
  operator's API: an empty `portName`, `retention` or
  `alertmanagerConfigMatcherStrategy.type`, which the CRD defaults to `web`,
  `120h` and `OnNamespace` (`portName: "" cannot be carried by the
  Prometheus operator API types (…)`). An empty `schedulerName` or
  `imagePullPolicy` is refused too: the operator copies each one unchanged
  to the pods, the second to its own containers, where the API server
  defaults an empty one. `TestMonitoringWorkloadKinds_DefaultedZeros` derives
  the list. It reads the type, the default markers of the operator's source,
  the field comments of the Kubernetes types, and the API server's defaulting
  code for their strings. It then shows each field refused on a document.
  `TestMonitoringWorkloadKinds_HostNetworkHostPort` shows the `hostPort`
  refusal. An authored `hostNetwork: false` is left out, and the API reads an
  absent one as `false`.

  **What the operator builds from the spec is checked where the API or the
  operator would break it.** The kind leaves to the API what the CRD's own
  schema refuses when the Alertmanager is applied (a `retention` of `1.5h` or
  `1d`, for one), which shows at once; it refuses
  what the CRD admits but the operator or the API then refuses on the
  StatefulSet or the pods built from it, which would fail late and out of
  sight. Each is refused, under any policy and none, at
  `pkg/alertmanager/statefulset.go` of prometheus-operator v0.94.1:
  - `version` unset where `image`, or a listed `alertmanager` entry, names the
    image: the operator chooses the container's flags by `version`, and by the
    deployed operator's default where none is, which a build cannot know and
    need not be the version the image runs (`version: required
    where image, or an entry of containers named alertmanager, names the
    image`); and a `version` the operator fails the reconcile on: one
    `semver.ParseTolerant` cannot parse, one under 0.15.0, or one of a major
    version above 0 (operator.go:902-909).
  - a `portName` the API refuses where the operator writes it: not an IANA
    service name (at most 15 characters, lower-case letters, digits and `-`);
    unless `listenLocal` is set, `mesh-tcp`/`mesh-udp`, the container ports the
    operator adds beside the web port; and unless `serviceName` names a Service
    of the author's, `tcp-mesh`/`udp-mesh`, the ports of the governing Service
    the operator creates (statefulset.go:223-250, :483-502).
  - a negative `replicas`, which the operator runs as 0.
  - `storage.volumeClaimTemplate.metadata.name` beside `storage.emptyDir` or
    `storage.ephemeral`, other than `alertmanager-<name>-db`: the operator
    mounts the data volume under that name and creates it as
    `alertmanager-<name>-db`, so the pods mount a volume that does not exist.
  - a storage arm in use whose claim the API refuses: the claim template arm
    (which an unset arm selects, an empty `storage` included) without
    `spec.resources.requests.storage` (unset or empty access modes, which are
    not serialized, the operator writes as `ReadWriteOnce`); the ephemeral arm
    without a claim template, its access modes or its storage request, which
    the operator uses as written; and on either, a storage request of `0` or
    less, as the API requires a positive one.
  - on the claim template arm, a claim template name that is not a DNS-1123
    label, which the operator names the data volume with, or that names a
    volume the operator adds, which the StatefulSet controller then replaces
    with the claim.
  - an entry of `volumes` named as a volume the operator adds: `config-volume`,
    `tls-assets`, `config-out`, `web-config`, `cluster-tls-config`,
    `notification-templates` where
    `alertmanagerConfiguration.templates` is set, the name the operator derives
    for each of `secrets` and `configMaps` (`secret-<name>`,
    `configmap-<name>`), and the data volume's: beside `storage.emptyDir` or
    `storage.ephemeral` a second volume of one name, and on the claim template
    arm one the StatefulSet controller replaces with the claim
    (`volumes[0] "config-volume": the name is a volume the Prometheus operator
    adds to every Alertmanager's pods; name the volume otherwise`).
    `web-config` and `cluster-tls-config` are refused whatever `version`
    names, though the operator adds them only for Alertmanager 0.22.0 and
    0.24.0 on: no field is held to `version` (go-kure/launcher#935). The
    volumes of the web and cluster TLS credentials are not checked: the
    operator names each after the credential's source with a hash appended,
    which the kind does not derive, so an entry under one of those names is
    left to the API to refuse. Two entries of `secrets`, or of `configMaps`,
    that the operator's naming gives one volume name (`alerts.config` and
    `alerts-config` both name `secret-alerts-config`) are refused as well:
    the operator adds a volume for each (statefulset.go:638-690). So is an
    entry whose volume name, cut to 63 characters, ends in `-`: the operator
    checks the name after the cut and fails to build the pods
    (`ResourceNamer.DNS1123Label`, statefulset.go:640-643).
  - an entry of `volumeMounts` at a path the operator mounts a volume at in
    the alertmanager container, as the API refuses two mounts at one path:
    `/alertmanager`, `/etc/alertmanager/config`, `config_out` and `certs`, the
    web and cluster TLS configuration files whatever `version` names,
    `/etc/alertmanager/templates` where `alertmanagerConfiguration.templates`
    is set, and `/etc/alertmanager/secrets/<name>` and
    `/etc/alertmanager/configmaps/<name>` for each entry of `secrets` and
    `configMaps` (:531-556, :575-692). The mounts of the web and cluster TLS
    credentials are left to the API, as their volumes are.
  - an entry of `additionalArgs` whose name, or that name with `no-` added or
    taken away, is a flag the operator generates for the spec: it then fails
    to build the pods (`BuildArgs`, `pkg/operator/argument.go:26-79`). The
    flags are `config.file`, `storage.path`, `data.retention`,
    `web.listen-address`, `web.route-prefix`, `cluster.reconnect-timeout`,
    `cluster.listen-address` (written `cluster.listen-address=` on one
    replica without `forceEnableClusterMode`), `cluster.peer` where a replica
    or `additionalPeers` is, and the flag of each field set among
    `externalUrl`, `enableFeatures`, `web.getConcurrency`, `web.timeout`,
    `limits`, `logLevel` other than `info`, `logFormat` other than `logfmt`,
    `clusterAdvertiseAddress`, the three cluster durations and `clusterTLS`
    (statefulset.go:289-508, :700-748), and `cluster.peer-name`,
    `cluster.label` and `web.config.file`. A flag the operator generates only
    from some version on is refused from that version on (`cluster.peer-name`
    0.30.0, `enable-feature` 0.27.0, `cluster.label` 0.26.0,
    `cluster.tls-config` 0.24.0, `web.config.file` 0.22.0, `web.get-concurrency`
    and `web.timeout` 0.17.0, `log.format` 0.16.0, the `limits` flags 0.28.0),
    and always where `version` is unset: the operator then runs its default
    version, v0.34.0 (`DefaultAlertmanagerVersion`, pkg/operator/defaults.go:25),
    above every one of them, and no flag is generated only up to a version. Not
    `dispatch.start-delay`: the operator leaves its own out where an argument
    names it.
  - an entry of `alertmanagerConfiguration.templates` whose key an earlier
    entry names, `configMap` or `secret`: the operator projects each key at
    the path of its name and skips a later entry of a key it has projected
    (statefulset.go:575-620), so that template would not be loaded.
  - a `web.tlsConfig`, `clusterTLS.server` or `clusterTLS.client` the
    operator's own validation refuses (a certificate and a key, each named
    once, and a certificate for the client; webconfig.New,
    clustertlsconfig.New): it then builds no pods.
  - `dnsPolicy: None` without `dnsConfig.nameservers`, and a pod-level
    `securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess: true` without
    `hostNetwork: true`: the API refuses the pods the operator copies them
    into.
  - a negative request or limit in `resources`, as merged, or in a listed
    container: the CRD's quantity pattern admits a sign, and the API refuses
    the container the operator builds with it.
  - a name the operator's objects cannot be named after: the data volume
    `alertmanager-<name>-db`, unless a claim template's name names it, and the
    hostname `alertmanager-<name>-<replicas-1>` of the last pod must each be a
    DNS-1123 label, so a name has no dot and at most 47 characters with the
    defaults. The refusal names the component, or `objectName` where that set
    the name.

  **The API's expression rules are not checked.** The types the spec reaches
  state one: an `updateStrategy` with a `rollingUpdate` must have the type
  `RollingUpdate`. The linked module ships no CRD, so there is no rule text
  to run through the validator the other kinds use: the rule is listed
  (`alertmanagerRulesLeft`) and left to the API server, and
  `TestMonitoringWorkloadKinds_RulesListed` fails when a dependency bump adds,
  drops or rewords a rule on a reached type. The API's other value rules
  (formats, enumerations, minima) are left to it as well.

  **What the type writes unauthored.** Every Alertmanager carries
  `resources: {}` and `alertmanagerConfigMatcherStrategy: {}`; the API
  defaults the `type` of the second to `OnNamespace`. An authored `storage`
  carries a `volumeClaimTemplate` whether or not one was authored, with
  `metadata: {}` and `status: {}` beside its `spec`; upstream documents that
  an `emptyDir` or an `ephemeral` takes precedence over it.

  **With or without a policy,** an authored `image` (unless a patch of
  `alertmanager` names an image, which replaces it in the container the
  operator builds, so only the patch's is run and held), the authored image
  of a listed container or init container, and the `reference` of an image
  volume are held to the tag rule (`ValidateImageRef`: `image: image "…" rejected:
  :latest tag not allowed`), and a resource block's request may not exceed
  its limit (`resources: cpu: request 2 must not exceed limit 1`,
  `containers[0] "proxy": resources: memory: request 2Gi must not exceed
  limit 1Gi`). The alertmanager container runs with `resources` as the
  operator fills it, an unset memory request as 200Mi whatever the limit,
  and with the requests and limits of a listed `alertmanager` entry merged
  over that block key by key (`makeStatefulSetSpec`, same source); the
  checks hold that merged block with the 200Mi filled where it names no
  memory request, and not the patch's block alone. So hugepages need no
  authored cpu or memory beside them, the filled request naming memory, and
  an extended resource the patch requests meets a limit named in
  `resources`. A memory limit under 200Mi with no memory
  request in either is refused, as the API would refuse the pods
  (`resources: memory: the unset request the Prometheus operator fills as
  200Mi must not exceed limit 100Mi; …`; with a patch, the path is
  `resources with containers[0] "alertmanager" merged over it`), while a
  request the patch names replaces the 200Mi and is held with the limit of
  `resources`. An entry named for a container the operator generates, in
  the list the operator generates it in, is merged into it, so such a patch
  may name no image; any other listed entry that names none is refused, as
  no pod could run it (`containers[1] "proxy": names no image, and the
  Prometheus operator generates no container of that name to merge it into;
  …`). A name listed twice in `containers` or `initContainers` is refused
  (`containers[1] "config-reloader": the name is listed already at
  containers[0], …`): the operator keeps only the last entry of a name
  (`MergePatchContainers`, `pkg/k8s/merge.go` at v0.94.1), so the policy
  would hold an entry that never runs. A name shared by an init container and
  a container of the pods, generated or listed, is refused, as the API
  requires the two lists' names to be unique together
  (`containers[0] "init-config-reloader": the name is also that of the init
  container the Prometheus operator generates, …`). A patch's ports are
  merged into the ports the operator gives the generated container by
  number, as a strategic merge does (`MergePatchContainers`, same source):
  in the patch's order, each port is merged into the first port of its
  number, the operator's or one an earlier port of the patch added, and
  replaces the name and protocol it names; a port of a number no port has is
  added. Where the operator gives the container no port (config-reloader
  under `listenLocal`), the merge takes the patch's ports as listed. The
  operator's ports, in its order, are the web port under
  `portName` at 9093/TCP and the config-reloader's `reloader-web` at
  8080/TCP unless `listenLocal` is set, `mesh-tcp` at 9094/TCP then
  `mesh-udp` at 9094/UDP, and the init-config-reloader's `reloader-init` at
  8081/TCP. A container whose ports, merged so, or as a listed container
  that is not a patch lists them, name two ports alike is refused, as the
  API refuses two ports of one name (`containers[0] "alertmanager":
  ports[1] "mesh-udp" at 9000/UDP: the Prometheus operator merges the
  patch's ports into the container's by number, which leaves another port
  of that name, the Prometheus operator's port at 9094/UDP, …`; a port at
  9094 renames `mesh-tcp`, never `mesh-udp`). A patch may rename a
  generated port and reuse its name, and a later port of the patch merges
  into one an earlier port added. Two `volumes` of one name are refused,
  as the API refuses the pods (`volumes[1] "scratch": the name is listed
  already at volumes[0], …`), and so is a `serviceName` that is not a
  DNS-1035 label (a leading digit included), the rule of every Service name
  in this package: the API refuses a Service of another name before
  Kubernetes 1.36 (by default), and the operator fails the reconcile where
  it finds no governing Service of the name (`serviceName: "1alerts" is not
  a valid Service name, which must be a DNS-1035 label: …`). Kubernetes 1.36
  and later admit such a name (go-kure/launcher#959). `retention`, `clusterGossipInterval`, `clusterPushpullInterval` and
  `clusterPeerTimeout` are refused where they parse as a duration of 0 or
  less (`retention: "0s" is not a positive duration: …`): the operator
  empties such a value before it builds the StatefulSet and runs the pods as
  if the field were unset (`discardZeroDurations`, same source). A value
  that does not parse is left to the API's pattern.
  A nonempty `externalUrl` that Alertmanager exits on at startup is refused
  too, though the operator and the API accept it: the operator passes it
  unchanged as `--web.external-url`, and Alertmanager exits where Go's
  `net/url` cannot parse it, and, from v0.19.0 on, where its scheme is not
  `http` or `https` (`externalUrl: not a URL of scheme http or https: …`;
  `cmd/alertmanager/main.go` of v0.28.1, `app/url.go` of v0.34.0). The scheme
  is held where `version` is unset or names v0.19.0 or later, its
  prerelease `v0.19.0-rc.0` included; an earlier version takes any scheme. Neither message names the value.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` refuses or passes; it writes nothing, and without
  a policy the same component builds. Refused, each with the class a workload
  kind's refusal has:
  - `image` where no patch of `alertmanager` replaces it, the image of a
    listed container or init container (a patch of `alertmanager` included),
    and an image volume's reference, outside the allowed registries
    (`oam.RefusalRegistry`);
  - under a policy that lists allowed registries, an image of a container
    the operator generates that the spec leaves to it (`oam.RefusalRegistry`):
    the `alertmanager` container's where neither `image` nor a patch of it
    names one, and `config-reloader`'s or `init-config-reloader`'s where no
    patch names one. See below;
  - `replicas` over the replica maximum, an unset one counted as the 1 the
    operator runs (`replicas 1 exceeds enforced maximum 0`,
    `oam.RefusalReplicaMaximum`);
  - the cpu or memory of `resources`, and of a listed container, over the
    maxima (`oam.RefusalResourceMaximum`), on a patch of one of the
    operator's containers as on any other; for the alertmanager container,
    the block it runs with, a patch merged over `resources`. Where that block
    names no memory request, the 200Mi the operator requests is held in its
    place (`resources, whose unset memory request the Prometheus operator
    fills as 200Mi: memory request "200Mi" exceeds enforced maximum
    "128Mi"`);
  - the storage a claim requests over the storage maximum
    (`oam.RefusalStorageMaximum`): of `storage`, the arm the operator uses,
    reading `emptyDir`, then `ephemeral`, then `volumeClaimTemplate` and
    taking the first that is set, so a claim template after an arm in use
    is not held, as no claim is made from it; and a generic ephemeral
    volume under `volumes`;
  - `hostNetwork: true` under a policy that does not allow the host network
    (`oam.RefusalHostNamespace`); the spec has no field for the host's
    process or IPC namespace;
  - a hostPath volume under `volumes` (`oam.RefusalHostPath`);
  - a privileged listed container, and a pod-level
    `securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess`, under a policy that does
    not allow privileged containers (`oam.RefusalPrivileged`), and a
    capability the policy does not allow (`oam.RefusalContainerCapability`).

  **An image the operator chooses is refused under a registry allowlist.**
  Where the spec names no image for a container the operator generates, the
  operator chooses the one it runs, and no registry allowlist reaches that
  choice, so a policy with a non-empty `AllowedRegistries` refuses it
  (`image: unset, so the Prometheus operator chooses the image the pods run,
  …`; `the image of the config-reloader container (containers): unset, …`)
  and the author names an image from one of the listed registries: `image`
  or a patch of `alertmanager` for the first, a patch of each reloader for
  the other two. Without such a list, it builds.

  **The operator's own values are held, not written.** Where the spec leaves
  `replicas` or the alertmanager container's memory request unset, the
  operator fills 1 and 200Mi before it builds the StatefulSet
  (`makeStatefulSet`, same source); the policy holds those values as if
  authored, and the emitted object still leaves both unset.

  `TestMonitoringWorkloadKinds_PodFieldsHeldOrListed` derives, from the type,
  the fields of the spec that carry the name of a field of a pod spec, a
  container or a StatefulSet's spec, the storage block, and any field that
  holds object metadata, and holds each to one of three answers: held to the
  policy, with a refusal shown on a document (the nine above: `image`,
  `replicas`, `resources`, `storage`, `volumes`, `containers`,
  `initContainers`, `securityContext`, `hostNetwork`); read by the wrapper
  (`podMetadata`, below); or stated with the reason it is neither. A
  dependency bump that adds such a field fails there, naming it. A field that
  shapes the pods under a name of the operator's own is not derived: `secrets`
  and `configMaps` mount the named Secrets and ConfigMaps of the namespace,
  read-only, into the alertmanager and config-reloader containers
  (`makeStatefulSetSpec`, same source), and fields such as `retention` and
  `logLevel` become arguments. The policy has no dimension for a Secret or
  ConfigMap volume or for an argument, so none of them is held. **Not
  held:**
  - **An image the operator chooses, under a policy without allowed
    registries,** as stated above. `version` does not name an image.
  - **What the operator adds on its own, beyond the images, the replica
    count and the memory request above:** the resources of a reloader no
    entry patches, the arguments it derives, the governing Service it
    creates where `serviceName` is unset. None of it is in the object.
  - **No policy default is filled.** An unauthored `replicas`, `resources`
    or `storage` stays unauthored under a policy that states a replica, a
    resource or a storage default: the operator, not launcher, decides what
    the omission means, and its own value is what the policy holds.
  - **The size limit of an `emptyDir`,** under `storage` or `volumes`, here
    as on every kind.
  - **Fields the environment policy has no dimension for,** on a pod kind
    either: where and in which order the pods are scheduled, how the
    StatefulSet rolls and what becomes of its claims, `serviceAccountName`
    (launcher creates no ServiceAccount for it and does not check that one
    exists), `automountServiceAccountToken`, the DNS settings, `hostAliases`,
    `hostUsers`, `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, `imagePullPolicy`,
    `imagePullSecrets` and `volumeMounts`.

  **`podMetadata` is the author's, and nothing is added to it.** The operator
  copies its labels and annotations onto the pods. The wrapper every
  component's objects pass reads it as it reads a workload's pod template: a
  key the consumer reserved (`ReservedMetadataKeys`) is refused, and so is
  the component label key with another value than the component's. It writes
  nothing there. So the operator's pods carry the component label only if the
  author writes the component's own value into `podMetadata.labels`;
  otherwise the NetworkPolicies generated for the component do not select
  them. The Alertmanager object itself carries the component label, as every
  object a component owns. The operator sets five labels of its own on the
  pods (`alertmanager`, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`,
  `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by`, `app.kubernetes.io/name`,
  `app.kubernetes.io/version`) and the annotation
  `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container`. A value authored for
  `app.kubernetes.io/version` replaces the operator's, which it copies
  `podMetadata.labels` over; the other four labels and the annotation it
  writes after them, so an authored value does not replace those
  (statefulset.go:446-460). Launcher does not refuse such a key.

  **The metadata of a claim template takes no component label.** The labels
  and annotations of `storage.volumeClaimTemplate` are held to the reserved
  metadata keys: the operator copies them onto the volume claim template of
  its StatefulSet, and so onto every claim the StatefulSet controller creates
  (`volume claim template label "…"`, go-kure/launcher#957). Beside
  `storage.emptyDir` or `storage.ephemeral` the operator makes no claim from
  it, and they are not read. Those of
  `storage.ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate` and of a generic ephemeral volume
  under `volumes` go onto a claim of a pod and are not read. All three are
  written as authored.

  **No field holds a credential in the clear, and none is checked.** Every
  credential of the spec is the key of a Secret (a `web` or `clusterTLS` key,
  an SMTP password, an OAuth2 client secret), and `configSecret`, `secrets`
  and `imagePullSecrets` name Secrets whose content is not in the object.
  `TestMonitoringWorkloadKinds_CredentialsHeldOrListed` derives the fields of
  the operator's types whose name suggests a credential and holds each to a
  stated reason it holds none. Free text that could hold one is written as
  authored, under a policy that forbids explicit secrets too:
  `additionalArgs`, `externalUrl`, and the `env` of a listed container, as on
  a pod kind.

  **Not covered.** Whether what the object refers to exists (the
  configuration Secret, a mounted Secret or ConfigMap, the ServiceAccount, a
  governing Service named by `serviceName`, the AlertmanagerConfig objects
  the selectors match). Upstream documents that, without the configuration
  Secret or its `alertmanager.yaml` key, the operator provisions a
  configuration that drops alert notifications. Launcher points no Prometheus
  at the Alertmanager. The object's status is the operator's and is not
  written.
- **webservice / worker** — `image`, `replicas` (default 1), `port` (webservice),
  plus the full `DeploymentSpec`-level surface they share with `deployment` —
  `strategy`, `minReadySeconds`, `revisionHistoryLimit`, `paused` and
  `progressDeadlineSeconds` (go-kure/launcher#341, see "Deployment-level
  properties" above). What still separates them from `deployment` is launcher's
  own opinions, which these two keep: `topologySpread` and the four-key
  `affinity` shorthand, and on `webservice` the `port` that drives the Service.
  Note the shorthand is what they keep — neither publishes the raw `corev1`
  `affinity`/`topologySpreadConstraints` that `deployment` does.
  The `webservice` rule implements the optional `oam.EndpointProvider`: it declares its own
  pods (`app: <component-name>`) on the declared `port` (its single `port` property drives both
  the container port and the Service port), letting a downstream platform synthesize generic
  app→app connections targeting a webservice. `worker` declares no in-cluster port and emits no
  Service, so it deliberately advertises no endpoint (not an `EndpointProvider`).
  - **`worker` is a component lowering rule, not a handler** (`WorkerRule`,
    go-kure/launcher#280). It runs worker's own parse, then re-expresses the
    component as a `deployment` of the same name: the authored properties are
    forwarded, the four-key `affinity` shorthand is evaluated exactly as before
    and forwarded as the raw `corev1` `affinity` (omitted when it evaluates to
    nothing), and `topologySpread` becomes a synthesized `topology-spread`
    trait placed before the authored traits (none when `topologySpread: false`).
    Authored traits and annotations are forwarded unchanged. Worker's published
    schema, its generated output and the `app: <component-name>` selector are
    unchanged — every example and golden fixture builds byte-identically — and
    the emitted component carries `Origin.Rule` `component/worker@v1alpha1`. Two
    differences are deliberate. A worker refused by its own parse now reads
    `component "w" (type "worker") in document …: <cause>` (the lowering
    engine's prefix) where it read `component "w": <cause>`; the cause is
    unchanged. A trait-lowering error on a worker's trait gains one chain line
    naming the `component/worker@v1alpha1` step; a trait handler's error reads as before.
    The former handler's affinity label-syntax check (see Common config) runs
    in the rule, before the raw `affinity` is forwarded, with the same
    `affinity: the shorthand evaluates to an affinity the API server would
    refuse: …` text. A key worker's parse refuses with a reason is refused
    there: an upstream field of its refusal maps, or `podActiveDeadlineSeconds`,
    which only Job pods may set. Any other key worker does not declare is dropped
    rather than forwarded to `deployment`; `kurel build` refuses both before
    lowering anyway.
  - **Both rules emit the component's ServiceAccount as a `serviceaccount`
    member** (go-kure/launcher#702) unless `serviceAccountName` is authored. A
    `worker` therefore lowers to a same-name sibling group of a `deployment` and
    a `serviceaccount`; a `webservice` to a `deployment`, a `service` and a
    `serviceaccount`. The member carries `automountServiceAccountToken: false`,
    the component's annotations, and the authored `prune-protection` and
    `force-replace` traits. The `deployment` member is handed the account's
    object name as `serviceAccountName` (the component name, unless
    `serviceAccountObjectName` or the `Naming` hook names the account, below),
    so it runs as that account and generates none of its own. The output is unchanged: the same ServiceAccount,
    in the same place, so every golden builds byte-identically. One consequence
    for a library caller: a registry that lowers `webservice` or `worker` must
    register a `serviceaccount` component handler too, or the build fails with
    `member type "serviceaccount" has no component handler`.
  - **Both rules turn each claim a `pvc` volume describes into a synthesized
    `pvc` trait** on the `deployment` member (go-kure/launcher#702), named
    `<component>-<volume>` as before unless the volume's `claimObjectName` or
    the `Naming` hook names it (below), and rewrite the volume to reference it
    by `claimName`, keeping `accessModes` so the non-RWX constraints still see it.
    The claims are generated as before, after the component's own objects. A
    registry that lowers `webservice` or `worker` must register the `pvc` trait
    handler too.
  - **`webservice` is a component lowering rule, not a handler**
    (`WebserviceRule`, go-kure/launcher#280). It runs webservice's own parse,
    then re-expresses the component as a same-name sibling group (see `pkg/oam`
    "Same-name sibling groups"): a `deployment` and then a `service`, both named
    after the component, deployed as one component — one tier, one
    bundle. The `deployment` member gets the authored properties
    webservice declares except `port`, `topologySpread` and `affinity`, plus
    the main container's one port `{name: http, containerPort: <port>}`; the
    `affinity` shorthand and `topologySpread` are handled as on `worker`. The
    `service` member gets one port `{name: http, port: <port>}` and the default
    selector `app: <component-name>`. Annotations go to both members. Each
    authored trait is forwarded unchanged, in authored order, to the member it
    acts on: `expose`, `ingress` and `httproute` go to the `service`;
    `prune-protection` and `force-replace` go to both; every other trait goes
    to the `deployment`. That includes `fluxcd-patches` and `fluxcd-postbuild`
    (not built in; a consumer that delivers through Flux registers them) and any
    trait type an extension registered, since the `deployment` member holds the
    pods. Webservice's published schema and its generated objects are
    unchanged, in the handler's order (Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount,
    claims). Each emitted component carries `Origin.Rule`
    `component/webservice@v1alpha1`. Four differences are deliberate. A refusal from
    webservice's own parse gains the lowering engine's prefix, as on `worker`;
    the cause is unchanged. The synthesized inbound NetworkPolicy opens an
    ingress `portName: http` as the port's number, where the handler opened the
    name `http`, which the container port also carried; the pods admitted are
    the same. Likewise, an ingress path on another component whose `backend`
    names a webservice's Service by `portName` opens that port's number on the
    webservice's pods, translated as on a `service` component. A route on
    another component whose `backend` names a webservice's Service on a port
    that Service does not expose (`port: 9090` on a webservice whose `port` is
    8080) no longer opens that port on the webservice's pods: the `service`
    member opens only its own declared ports, as a `service` component does.
    The route was already broken, since the Service has no such port to
    forward. Webservice is no longer a handler a library caller converts with
    directly, so the nameless-config fallback the handlers keep does not apply
    to it: the engine only lowers a named component.
  - **A `webservice` component name must be a valid Service name.** It always
    emits a Service named after the component, and the API server validates
    a Service's `metadata.name` as a DNS-1035 label: at most 63 characters,
    lowercase letters, digits and `-`, starting with a letter and ending with
    a letter or digit. That is stricter than the DNS-1123 subdomain every
    component name already passes, so `api.v1`, a 64-character name and
    `1api` are refused at conversion (`name: "1api" is not a valid Service
    name, which must be a DNS-1035 label`) instead of building a manifest the
    cluster rejects on apply (go-kure/launcher#546). `Generate` applies the
    same rule to the Application name it is handed. `worker` emits no Service
    and keeps accepting such a name, within the container-name rule above.
    The rule holds for the component name whatever the Service is named:
    `serviceObjectName` (below) does not lift it.
  - **`deploymentObjectName`, `serviceObjectName` and
    `serviceAccountObjectName` name the objects the component generates**
    (go-kure/launcher#787), each in place of the component name and each on its
    own: the Deployment, the Service (`webservice` only; `worker` generates
    none and does not declare the property) and the ServiceAccount. A name is
    used as written, never shortened. The Deployment's and the ServiceAccount's
    are DNS-1123 subdomains, the Service's a DNS-1035 label; anything else is
    refused (`naming the Service: serviceObjectName "web.v1" cannot be the name
    for role "workload-service": not a valid DNS-1035 label: …`). Without the
    property the `Naming` hook is asked (roles `workload-deployment`,
    `workload-service`, `workload-serviceaccount`), and without an answer the
    object keeps the component name, so a document that sets none builds
    byte-identically. Each name is held against every other resolved name of
    its kind and namespace: two components given one `serviceObjectName`, or a
    `service` component whose object carries a `webservice`'s Service name, are
    refused as a name collision with both named.
    - *They name the objects alone.* The members keep the component's name, so
      the `app` label, the pod template's labels, the Deployment's and the
      Service's selectors, the main container, the claims' default names
      (`<component>-<volume>`) and every name a trait derives (`<component>-hpa`,
      `<component>-httproute`) stay as they were.
    - *A `pvc` volume's `claimObjectName` names the claim that volume
      generates* (role `workload-volume-claim`), in place of
      `<component>-<volume>`, used as written: a DNS-1123 subdomain, never
      shortened. The volume mounts the claim by that name. Without it the
      `Naming` hook is asked once per such volume. A volume with `claimName`
      references an existing claim and generates none, so `claimObjectName`
      beside it is refused and the hook is not asked for it. Two volumes, or
      a volume and another component, that give one claim name are refused as
      a name collision.
    - *What launcher writes to a renamed object follows it.* The `scaler`
      trait's `scaleTargetRef` names the Deployment, whatever the Service and
      the ServiceAccount are named. A routing trait's own backend (`expose`,
      `ingress`, `httproute`) is the Service, and a route naming that Service
      still resolves to the component for the synthesized NetworkPolicy. The
      pods' `serviceAccountName` and the `rbac` trait's subject name the
      ServiceAccount.
    - **A renamed Service changes its DNS name: the Service's name is the name
      it is reached at in the cluster. Launcher builds no such address, so every
      address written with the component name (an `env` value, a URL in another
      component's properties, a backend another component's route names) is the
      author's to change.**
    - *`serviceAccountObjectName` names the account the component generates,
      `serviceAccountName` an account that exists.* With `serviceAccountName`
      the component generates none, so the two together are refused
      (`serviceAccountObjectName and serviceAccountName are both set: …`), and
      the hook is not asked for an account.
  - **An ingress `portName` on a `webservice` must be `http`.** The Service's
    one port is named `http`, so an `ingress` path whose implicit backend is
    this component's Service (no `backend`, or `backend` naming that Service)
    and that addresses it by any other `portName` is refused at build time
    (`cannot route implicit backend to port "name"`), just as a numbered
    `port` other than the component's `port` is (go-kure/launcher#545).
- **deployment** — the kind-named Deployment (see "Deployment-level
  properties" above): the shared container-level, pod-level and
  `DeploymentSpec`-level surface, the last of which it now shares with
  `webservice` and `worker` rather than owning. What distinguishes it is mostly
  what it leaves out: no `topologySpread`, no four-key `affinity` shorthand, no
  `port`; it declares no endpoint and emits no Service. It is not `worker` minus
  a few things either — it reads nulls as omissions across its whole surface,
  which the role kinds do not. The one thing it
  adds is the raw `corev1` scheduling surface the role kinds lack: `affinity`,
  `tolerations` and `topologySpreadConstraints` as the API shapes
  (go-kure/launcher#412, see "Raw scheduling properties" above). That is the
  same distinction in the other direction — the role kinds carry the opinion,
  this kind carries the API.
- **service** — the kind-named Service (go-kure/launcher#411), an independent
  component rather than half of a workload: it emits the Service and nothing
  else, and the workload component whose pods it selects owns their
  ServiceAccount. `selector` defaults to `app: <component name>`, the label
  every workload kind puts on its pods; set it when the Service fronts a
  workload named differently (a `deployment` named `api-server` behind a
  `service` named `api`). `ports` is the full `corev1.ServicePort` list, at
  least one entry unless the Service is headless or of type `ExternalName`: `port` (required), `targetPort` (a number or a container
  port name, published as the `Types: [integer, string]` union
  (go-kure/launcher#383), so a value of any other type is rejected by property
  validation before the parser sees it; defaults to `port`), `protocol` (`TCP`, `UDP` or `SCTP`; defaults
  to `TCP`), `name` (required once there is more than one port; names and
  port/protocol pairs must be unique), `nodePort` (1-65535, only with `type`
  `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`, unique per protocol, as the API requires; two
  refusals are launcher's own: `0`, which the API reads as "allocate one" —
  leave the key out instead — and a node port on an `ExternalName` Service,
  which the API accepts; the
  cluster's own node port range is narrower and is checked on apply) and
  `appProtocol` (a qualified name such as `http` or `kubernetes.io/h2c`).
  `type` is `ClusterIP` (default), `NodePort`, `LoadBalancer` or
  `ExternalName`. An empty `selector` is refused.
  - **ExternalName.** `type: ExternalName` (go-kure/launcher#790) emits a DNS
    alias for `externalName`, which is then required: a DNS-1123 subdomain,
    with one trailing dot allowed. The Service selects no pods, so `selector`
    is refused with it (launcher's own rule; the API accepts and ignores one),
    and so are `clusterIP: None`, `ipFamilies` and `ipFamilyPolicy`; `ports`
    is optional. On any other type `externalName` is refused (launcher's own
    rule; the API ignores it there). Whatever ports it lists, an ExternalName
    Service has no first port for a routing trait and no NetworkPolicy
    endpoint: an `ingress` or `httproute` trait refuses it as an implicit
    backend (`component "db" has no service port`), a trait-level
    `servicePort` is refused, and it declares no endpoint. As on a port-less
    headless Service, the refusal is of the component as a backend, not of
    the trait: a trait on it that names another Service explicitly is carried
    as on any component, and that route's policy is the routed Service's. It
    still owns its name
    (`BackendServiceName`): a route from another component naming it is a
    route to a Service of this application, so that route's `backendSelector`
    is not trusted, and **no inbound NetworkPolicy is synthesized for that
    route**, in a same-name sibling group either: the Service leads to no pods
    of the cluster, and the group's component label is on its workload's
    pods, which the Service does not lead to. Named apart from its component
    (`objectName`), it owns that name instead: a route naming the Service's
    name gets no policy, and one naming the component's name is a route to a
    Service from elsewhere.
  - **Further `ServiceSpec` fields** (go-kure/launcher#790). Each is written
    only when authored; unauthored, the API server's own default applies. The
    rules are the API server's (`validateService`), except where marked as
    launcher's own.

    | Property | Rules |
    |----------|-------|
    | `externalTrafficPolicy` | `Cluster` or `Local`. Only with `type` `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`. |
    | `internalTrafficPolicy` | `Cluster` or `Local`. |
    | `trafficDistribution` | `PreferSameZone`, `PreferSameNode`, or `PreferClose` (the deprecated name of `PreferSameZone`). |
    | `sessionAffinity` | `None` or `ClientIP`. |
    | `sessionAffinityConfig` | Only with `sessionAffinity: ClientIP`. `clientIP.timeoutSeconds` is required once the key is authored (launcher's own: the API server would default it), 1-86400. |
    | `publishNotReadyAddresses` | A boolean; written only when `true`. |
    | `ipFamilies` | `IPv4` and/or `IPv6`, each once, at most two. |
    | `ipFamilyPolicy` | `SingleStack`, `PreferDualStack` or `RequireDualStack`; `SingleStack` is refused with two `ipFamilies` (the API server's allocator refuses it). |
    | `loadBalancerClass` | A qualified name. Only with `type: LoadBalancer`. |
    | `loadBalancerSourceRanges` | CIDRs in canonical form (launcher's own: the API tolerates surrounding spaces and some non-canonical forms). Only with `type: LoadBalancer`. |
    | `loadBalancerIP` | Only with `type: LoadBalancer` (launcher's own: the API ignores it elsewhere). The value is not validated, as in the API. |
    | `allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts` | A boolean. Only with `type: LoadBalancer`. |
    | `healthCheckNodePort` | 1-65535. Only with `type: LoadBalancer` and `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`. `0` is refused (launcher's own: the API reads it as "allocate one"; leave the key out instead). |

    `externalIPs` and `clusterIPs` are refused, and so is a literal
    `clusterIP` address. `externalIPs` routes traffic for addresses the
    cluster does not manage and is deprecated by the API; a Service's cluster
    IPs are the cluster's to allocate. In a document all three are refused by
    property validation before the parser runs: `externalIPs` and `clusterIPs`
    as unsupported fields, each with the kind's reason after the list of
    allowed keys (go-kure/launcher#790), and a literal `clusterIP` address as
    a value outside the property's enum, which has `None` alone.
  - **Headless.** `clusterIP: None` (go-kure/launcher#690) emits
    `spec.clusterIP: None`: no virtual IP, and cluster DNS resolves the name to
    the selected pods, as a StatefulSet's governing Service needs. It requires
    `type: ClusterIP` (the default), since the API server refuses a headless
    `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` Service. `None` is the only value: a literal
    address is refused, and so is an empty string, rather than read as
    absence. A headless Service may have no `ports` at all; without
    `clusterIP`, at least one port is still required (`ports: at least one
    port is required`), except on an `ExternalName` Service (above). A
    port-less Service has no first port, so routing
    traits refuse it as an implicit backend, refuse a trait-level
    `servicePort` on it, and it declares no NetworkPolicy endpoint. It still
    owns its name (`BackendServiceName`): a route from another component
    naming it is a route to a Service of this application, not an external
    backend, so that route's `backendSelector` is not trusted and, with no
    TCP port to translate, no allow is synthesized. Without `clusterIP` the
    Service carries no `clusterIP`, as before.
  - **The component name must be a valid Service name.** It becomes the
    Service's `metadata.name`, which the API server validates as a DNS-1035
    label: at most 63 characters, lowercase letters, digits and `-`, starting
    with a letter and ending with a letter or digit. That is stricter than the
    DNS-1123 subdomain every component name already passes, so `api.v1`, a
    64-character name and `1api` are refused here (`name: "api.v1" is not a
    valid Service name, which must be a DNS-1035 label`) instead of building a
    manifest the cluster rejects on apply. `Generate` applies the same rule to
    the Application name it is handed.
  - **Routing traits use the first port.** `ingress`, `httproute` and `expose`
    (which lowers to one of the two) on a `service` component resolve their
    implicit backend to `ports[0].port` and refuse any other port on it,
    whether it is named by number (`cannot route implicit backend to port N`)
    or by an ingress path's `portName` (`cannot route implicit backend to port
    "name"`); a `portName` must be the first port's own name, so an unknown
    name is refused too. Naming the component's own Service as the backend
    (`backend: api` on an ingress path, `backendRefs: [{name: api, port:
    9000}]` on an httproute) is still the implicit backend and is refused the
    same way. To reach a later port, put the routing trait on another
    component and name this Service there as an explicit backend, with that
    port.
  - **Synthesized NetworkPolicy.** The `{component}-allow-ingress-traffic`
    policy for traffic routed to a `service` selects its `selector` pods — not
    the component label, which no pod carries — and opens the `targetPort` of
    each routed TCP port. A route that reaches only a UDP or SCTP port
    synthesizes no policy, and neither does a route to an `ExternalName`
    Service, which has no pods to open a port on (above). In a same-name
    sibling group whose `selector`
    picks a sibling's own pods, the policy selects the component label
    instead, but only when `IdentityTargetPorts` is true: the Service has at
    least one port and every port, whatever its protocol, has a numeric
    `targetPort` equal to its own `port`. Otherwise it keeps the `selector`.
    Either way the routed ports are translated to their `targetPort` and
    only TCP ones are opened (see `pkg/oam` "Same-name sibling groups").
  - It implements `oam.EndpointProvider`: one endpoint, the `selector` pods on
    every TCP `targetPort` (deduplicated). A Service with no TCP port declares
    none, and neither does an `ExternalName` Service.
  - **No policy check.** `service` has no `ApplyPolicy`, deliberately
    (go-kure/launcher#794, item 2): none of its properties maps to an
    environment-policy method, so there is nothing to enforce. The policy
    makes no statement about a Service's `type`, so `NodePort` and
    `LoadBalancer` build under every policy. **`type: ExternalName` has no
    capability gate either: whoever may author a `service` component may give
    an in-cluster name to any DNS name outside the cluster**, and workloads
    that resolve the Service name are sent there. `nodePort`,
    `loadBalancerSourceRanges`, `loadBalancerIP` and `externalTrafficPolicy`
    are accepted the same way. The object kind policy
    (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922) holds kinds, not these
    fields: it can keep Services out of a build, not one `type`.
- **serviceaccount**, **persistentvolumeclaim**, **configmap**
  (go-kure/launcher#702) are kind-named projections of one object each. Each
  emits that object, named after the component, and nothing else, so another
  component refers to it by the component name. They are the authorable forms
  of the objects the workload kinds generate for themselves today, and they
  carry no launcher opinions. Like every component, they are in no tier
  unless a tier annotation or placement policy places them. `serviceaccount`
  and `configmap` have no `ApplyPolicy`, deliberately (go-kure/launcher#794,
  item 2): none of their properties maps to an environment-policy method
  (`imagePullSecrets` names Secrets, not a registry), so there is nothing to
  enforce. `persistentvolumeclaim` has one, for the storage default and
  maximum.
  - `serviceaccount` publishes `automountServiceAccountToken` and
    `imagePullSecrets` (`[{name}]`). An unauthored
    `automountServiceAccountToken` stays unset, which Kubernetes reads as
    true. The account a role kind generates sets it to false, so a
    `serviceaccount` replacing that account authors `false` to keep the same
    posture. A workload runs as it through `serviceAccountName`, which also
    stops a role kind from generating its own account.
  - `persistentvolumeclaim` publishes `size`, `storageClassName`,
    `accessModes` (default `[ReadWriteOnce]`) and `volumeMode`. The claim is
    built by the same `BuildPVC` as a `pvc` volume, so the two agree on every
    field they share, including the explicit-empty `storageClassName: ""`,
    which requests no class. The `pvc` trait is this kind's twin
    (go-kure/launcher#741): it runs the kind's own `ParseClaimProperties`,
    `ApplyClaimPolicy` and `GenerateClaim`, so the same properties build the
    same claim. Only the ownership fields differ: the claim's name, its `app`
    label, namespace and bundle. An unauthored `storageClassName` (absent or
    `null`) comes from the ClusterProfile `pvc` capability's
    `storageClassName`, as the trait's does (go-kure/launcher#742); with no
    binding it stays unset, which is the cluster's default class. **Pre-GA
    output change**: the kind used to ignore that binding, so an existing
    claim built from it got the cluster's default class when it was created,
    if the cluster had one. A claim's assigned `storageClassName` cannot
    change: if the binding's class differs from it, the claim fails to apply
    until it is recreated or the assigned class is authored. A claim created
    with no class may take one later, so it applies. An unauthored `size`
    comes from the EnvironmentPolicy storage default; with neither, the build
    fails with `size: required …`. The policy's maximum storage size applies
    either way. A workload mounts the claim through a `pvc` volume's
    `claimName` (see "Referencing an existing claim" below). A claim name
    another component also generates (for example a `pvc` trait of the same
    name) is refused as a generated-object collision.

    Four more claim-spec fields are read (go-kure/launcher#790), by the kind
    and by the `pvc` trait alike (`claim_spec.go`). Each is written only when
    authored, so a document that authors none builds the claim it built
    before. A workload's `pvc` volume does not take them.

    | Property | Rule |
    |----------|------|
    | `selector{matchLabels, matchExpressions[]}` | A label query over the PersistentVolumes that may back the claim, parsed as a `statefulset` claim template's is. A claim with a selector is never dynamically provisioned. An empty selector is refused: this is launcher's own rule, the API server reads it as "every volume". |
    | `dataSourceRef{apiGroup, kind, name, namespace}` | The object to populate the volume from, with the rules of upstream `validateDataSourceRef` (the `dataSourceRef` row under "StatefulSet-level and claim-template properties"). |
    | `volumeName` | The name of the PersistentVolume to bind to. Must be a DNS-1123 subdomain: launcher's own rule, since `ValidatePersistentVolumeClaimSpec` does not read the field and a value that cannot name a PersistentVolume would leave the claim Pending for good. |
    | `volumeAttributesClassName` | A DNS-1123 subdomain (`ValidateClassName`). |

    **No policy check on `volumeName`.** It is accepted with no capability
    gate and no EnvironmentPolicy method; the object kind policy
    (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922) holds kinds, not this
    field. A claim that names a volume binds to
    that PersistentVolume and to no other, with no dynamic provisioning, so
    **whoever may author a claim may ask for any PersistentVolume of the
    cluster by name**. The cluster still decides: the volume must be unbound
    or reserved for this claim, and must satisfy the claim's size, access
    modes, class, attributes class and volume mode (the PersistentVolume
    controller's `checkVolumeSatisfyClaim`). The storage default and maximum
    still apply to the claim's `size`.

    `dataSource` is refused: it is the superseded spelling of `dataSourceRef`,
    which the API server mirrors into it. The long `resources` spelling of
    `size` is not read on a standalone claim.
  - `configmap` publishes `data` (string values only: a number or a boolean
    is refused rather than stringified), `binaryData` (base64; a key may not
    also appear in `data`) and `immutable`. The `data` values and the decoded
    `binaryData` values together may hold at most 1,048,576 bytes, the limit
    the API server enforces; a larger ConfigMap is refused at build time. That
    check is the exported `CheckConfigMapSize(data, binaryData)`. A key the API
    server refuses in a ConfigMap is refused by the exported
    `ValidateConfigMapKey(field, key)`. Keys are checked in sorted order, so
    with several bad entries the one reported is the same on every build. It is
    a different type from the `configmap` trait, which attaches a ConfigMap to
    another component. The trait is this kind's twin (go-kure/launcher#741): it
    reads `data`, `binaryData` and `immutable` through the exported
    `ParseConfigMapProperties(props)` and builds the ConfigMap through
    `GenerateConfigMap(config, name, namespace, labels)`, so the same properties
    give the same ConfigMap and the same refusals on both paths.
- **secret** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a v1
  Secret, on the recipe of `configmap`: it emits the Secret, named after
  the component (or its `objectName`) and carrying the component's `app`
  label, and nothing else, so a workload's `secret` volume, `envFrom` or
  `secretKeyRef` names it by that name.
  - It publishes `stringData` (plain string values: a number, a boolean or a
    nested object is refused, not stringified), `data` (base64; a key may not
    also appear in `stringData`, where the API server would let `stringData`
    win silently), `type` and `immutable`. An unauthored `type` and
    `immutable` stay unset (the API server stores `Opaque` for an unset
    type), and the keys a type requires are left to the API server.
  - Every entry is emitted under `data`, base64-encoded as the API serializes
    it, and never under `stringData`: the object written is the object the
    API server stores. **base64 is an encoding, not encryption**, so the
    build output is as sensitive as the document, and so is every place that
    output is committed or pushed to. Prefer a Secret created out of band (an
    `external-secret` trait, a sealed or externally managed Secret) for
    anything that must not be in the output.
  - The decoded values together may hold at most 1,048,576 bytes, the limit
    the API server enforces (the exported `CheckSecretSize(data)`); a key the
    API server refuses is refused by the exported `ValidateSecretKey(field,
    key)`. Keys are checked in sorted order. **No refusal carries a value**:
    an entry is named by its key, a wrong value by its type, and a base64
    error by its key alone.
  - *Policy.* Unlike `configmap`, the kind has an `ApplyPolicy`: a policy
    that forbids explicit secrets (`oam.ExplicitSecretPolicy`, see the
    `pkg/oam` README) refuses the component with a violation naming it,
    `secret: the environment policy forbids explicit secrets; reference a
    Secret created out of band instead`, as it refuses the `secret` trait, a
    `helm` component's `secretValues` and a Secret a `passthrough` or
    `manifests` component carries. A policy that does not implement that
    interface, and no policy, allow it.
  - It is a different type from the `secret` trait, which attaches a Secret
    to another component. The trait is this kind's twin: it reads the same
    four properties through the exported `ParseSecretProperties(props)` and
    builds the Secret through `GenerateSecret(config, name, namespace,
    labels)`, and its schema is the kind's plus `name`, so the same
    properties give the same Secret and the same refusals on both paths. Only
    the ownership fields differ: the Secret's name, its labels, its namespace
    and the bundle it is placed in.
  - *Names.* The kind's Secret is claimed under role `object`. A `secret`
    component and a `secret` trait naming one Secret are refused; the trait
    itself claims no name. It names its own Secret under no role, so the two
    meet among the generated objects (`generated-object collision: Secret
    "shop/shared" is generated by both component "shared" and sub-application
    "shared" of component "web"; …`), as a `configmap` component and trait
    do. The Secret a `helm` component generates for
    `secretValues` is claimed under role `values-secret`, as the same kind,
    so a `secret` component under that name is refused as a name collision
    with both named.
- **namespace**, **limitrange**, **resourcequota** (go-kure/launcher#790) are
  kind-named projections of one Kubernetes core object each, built on the
  recipe of the `cnpg-pooler`, `cnpg-database` and `cnpg-objectstore` kinds:
  one schema key per json field of the object's spec type, the whole property
  map decoded strictly into that type under the null contract, and two
  spellings of one field refused. `TestCoreKindSchemas_CoverSpec` holds each
  schema to the linked type by reflection. Each emits its object, named after
  the component,
  with the authored spec and nothing else: the handler adds no annotation and
  no label of its own, not an `app` label either. The transform then sets the component
  label on the object, as on every object a component owns
  (go-kure/launcher#788). None
  runs a pod or requests storage, so `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op. Like every
  component, they are in no tier unless a tier annotation or placement policy
  places them.
  The properties are the spec fields, and `labels` and `annotations` for the
  object's metadata ("The object's labels and annotations" below).
  - `namespace` publishes `finalizers`, the one field of
    `corev1.NamespaceSpec`. A Namespace is cluster-scoped: the object carries
    no namespace, whatever namespace the application is built for. The
    component name is the Namespace's name, which the API holds to a DNS-1123
    label (at most 63 characters, no dot), narrower than a component name;
    any other name is refused, naming it. A Namespace that needs the Pod
    Security Admission labels (`pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce` and its
    siblings) writes them under `labels`.
  - `limitrange` publishes `limits`, the one field of `corev1.LimitRangeSpec`,
    and emits the LimitRange in the build namespace. `limits` is required: the
    Go type cannot omit it, so an unauthored one (absent or `null`) would be
    written as `limits: null` and is refused with `limits: required …`. An
    authored `limits: []` is kept: a LimitRange that enforces nothing. Each
    limit's `type` is required for the same reason (`limits[1].type: required
    …`), and two limits of one type are refused by path, as the API refuses
    them. The other value rules (which type names exist, `min` at most `max`,
    what a `Pod` limit may not set) are left to the API server. A quantity
    written as a number is emitted in its canonical string form (`cpu: 2`
    becomes `cpu: "2"`). The limits constrain the pods and claims of the
    namespace at admission; the environment policy is not applied to them.
  - `resourcequota` publishes `hard`, `scopes` and `scopeSelector`, the
    fields of `corev1.ResourceQuotaSpec`, and emits the ResourceQuota in the
    build namespace. The API requires none of them, so a component with no
    properties is a quota that limits nothing. Which resource names, scopes
    and selector operators exist is left to the API server. A quantity written
    as a number is emitted in its canonical string form
    (`persistentvolumeclaims: 10` becomes `"10"`). The quota bounds what the
    namespace may hold in total; the environment policy is not applied to it.
- **persistentvolume** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of
  a v1 PersistentVolume, on the recipe of `namespace`, `limitrange` and
  `resourcequota`: one schema key per json field of
  `corev1.PersistentVolumeSpec`, the property map decoded strictly into that
  type, two spellings of one field refused, and one object named after the
  component, with the authored spec; the handler adds no label and no
  annotation of its own, and the transform sets the component label. The spec
  embeds `corev1.PersistentVolumeSource`, so each volume source (`nfs`, `csi`,
  `hostPath`, …) is a top-level property, as it is a top-level field of the
  object's spec. A PersistentVolume is cluster-scoped: the object carries no
  namespace, whatever namespace the application is built for. The API requires
  `capacity`, `accessModes` and exactly one source; those and the other value
  rules are left to the API server, so a component with no properties builds a
  volume the server refuses. A quantity written as a number is emitted in its
  canonical string form. The object's labels and annotations are the `labels`
  and `annotations` properties.

  **Policy.** Unlike `namespace`, `limitrange` and `resourcequota`, a
  PersistentVolume is held to the
  environment policy (`enforcePersistentVolumePolicy`):
  - A `hostPath` or `local` source is refused unless `AllowHostPathVolumes()`
    allows it. Both name a path on the node (`local` a disk, partition or
    directory there), and a pod that binds the volume through a claim reads
    and writes that path, as it does through a `hostPath` volume of its own.
  - `capacity.storage` is held to the storage maximum (`MaxStorageSize()`), as
    the storage a claim requests is.

  One check covers every path that can produce the object: this kind, and the
  rendered-object check that template delivery (`helmtemplate`), `passthrough`
  and `manifests` run, where the refusal names the object (`passthrough: object
  PersistentVolume "data": spec.hostPath: …`). On those three paths a
  PersistentVolume in an API version the build cannot read is refused, since
  its source and capacity cannot be checked.

  Of the other source types of `corev1.PersistentVolumeSource` (k8s.io/api
  v0.37.1, `core/v1/types.go`), all but `csi` and `flexVolume` name a remote
  endpoint or disk, not a path on the node, and are not gated. **Not covered:** a `csi` or
  `flexVolume` source. Each names a driver and options only the driver
  interprets, and no field says whether a node path is exposed; a pod's `csi`
  and `flexVolume` volumes are unchecked for the same reason. A driver that
  exposes a node path therefore passes the gate. This is a decided limit
  (go-kure/launcher#794, item 12): the environment policy makes no statement
  about driver-defined volumes, on pods or on PersistentVolumes. One (an
  allowlist of driver names, for instance) would be a new part of the policy
  every consumer implements, and no use case asked for it.

  **Breaking:** before this kind, a PersistentVolume that a chart rendered, a
  `passthrough` component held or a `manifests` source yielded reached the
  output unchecked. One with a `hostPath` or `local` source, or with
  `capacity.storage` over the storage maximum, is now refused where it built
  before — and with no policy passed a `hostPath` or `local` one is always
  refused, since `NoopPolicy` allows no hostPath volume. A consumer allows it
  through its policy (`AllowHostPathVolumes()`, `MaxStorageSize()`), not per
  component.
- **pod** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a v1 Pod, on
  the same recipe: one schema key per json field of `corev1.PodSpec`, the
  property map decoded strictly into that type, two spellings of one field
  refused, and one Pod named after the component in the build namespace, with
  the authored spec. The handler adds the `app` label and nothing else: no
  annotation, no ServiceAccount, no `automountServiceAccountToken`, no
  resources, no probe. The `app` label (`app: <component>`, see "The `app`
  label") is the one every workload kind gives its pods and the one launcher's
  traits and Services select on: a `networkpolicy` trait's policy matches the
  Pod by it, and a `service` component reaches it with `selector: {app:
  <component>}`. The transform
  then sets the component label, as on every object a component owns
  (go-kure/launcher#788). It is a bare Pod: no controller recreates it, and it
  is not the workload shape of `webservice`, `worker` or `deployment` — a
  property of those (`image`, `ports`, `env` at the top level) is refused as
  not a PodSpec field.

  **Traits.** The pod is a trait target: `security-context`, a `configmap`
  trait's `mountPath` and an `external-secret` trait's `envFrom`/`mountPath`
  change its spec as they change a workload kind's pod template.
  `topology-spread` is Deployment-only and refuses a `pod` component.

  **Refused when the component is read**, with or without a policy:
  - `ephemeralContainers`, `priority` and `overhead`, with the texts the
    workload kinds give. A pod cannot be created with ephemeral containers,
    and the Priority and RuntimeClass admission controllers set the other two
    and reject a differing value; an author sets `priorityClassName` or
    `runtimeClassName`. The three are not in the schema, so a caller that
    validates the properties against it first, as `kurel build` does, refuses
    each as an unsupported field whatever its value, an empty one included. A
    caller that converts the component without that validation gets the texts
    above, and there an empty `ephemeralContainers` or `overhead` is read as
    unset. Cost: on a cluster that runs without those admission controllers
    the two fields cannot be authored through this kind.
  - An unauthored `containers`. The API's other value rules (an empty list, a
    container without a name, …) are left to the API server.
  - An image without a tag or digest, or tagged `:latest`, on every init and
    regular container (`ValidateImageRef`), so a container without an image
    too.
  - The same on the `reference` of an image volume (`volumes[0] "ext"
    image.reference: image "…" rejected: …`); a volume that names no
    reference is not checked. See *Image volumes* below.
  - A value the API server would replace with its default: the Go type omits
    a zero there, so the authored value cannot be carried
    (`containers[0].ports[0].protocol: "" cannot be carried by the Kubernetes
    API types (the field is omitted when zero, so the API server would apply
    its default "TCP")`). These are:
    - written as `0`: a probe's `timeoutSeconds`, `periodSeconds`,
      `successThreshold` or `failureThreshold` (defaults 1, 10, 1, 3), on the
      liveness, readiness and startup probes of every init and regular
      container;
    - written as `""`: `dnsPolicy` (`ClusterFirst`), `restartPolicy`
      (`Always`) and `schedulerName` (`default-scheduler`); on every init and
      regular container `imagePullPolicy`, `terminationMessagePath`
      (`/dev/termination-log`), `terminationMessagePolicy` (`File`), a port's
      `protocol` (`TCP`), an `env` entry's `valueFrom.fieldRef.apiVersion`
      (`v1`), and the `httpGet` `path` (`/`) and `scheme` (`HTTP`) of its
      probes and of its `postStart` and `preStop` hooks; on a volume, the
      `fieldRef.apiVersion` of a `downwardAPI` item, also inside a `projected`
      source (`v1`), an image volume's `pullPolicy`, `iscsi.iscsiInterface`
      (`default`), `rbd.pool`, `rbd.user` and `rbd.keyring` (`rbd`, `admin`,
      `/etc/ceph/keyring`) and `scaleIO.storageMode` and `scaleIO.fsType`
      (`ThinProvisioned`, `xfs`). An `imagePullPolicy` or image volume
      `pullPolicy` defaults to `Always` for an image tagged `latest` or naming
      neither a tag nor a digest, else to `IfNotPresent`; the image rule
      refuses the first two, so an accepted image gets `IfNotPresent`. The
      code defaults an image volume's `pullPolicy` only under the
      `ImageVolume` feature gate, which is on and locked since Kubernetes
      1.36;
    - written as `0` when `hostNetwork` is `true`: a container port's
      `hostPort`, which the API server sets to the port's `containerPort`. It
      does so on the Pod, so on a template it applies to each pod created
      from it.

    Two strings the API server sets are not refused. `serviceAccountName`
    and its deprecated spelling `serviceAccount` are kept equal, so an
    authored `""` with neither set stays `""`; the `default` service account
    is set by an admission plugin, not by defaulting. A string field that is
    a pointer in the Go type (a gRPC probe's `service`, an `httpGet`
    `protocol`, a container's `restartPolicy`, a `hostPath` `type`,
    `azureDisk`'s fields) carries an authored `""`, so nothing is lost there.

    The list is held to the API server's own defaulting code by
    `TestKubernetesDefaulters_MatchVendoredSource`. It reads an excerpt of
    that code, copied unmodified from kubernetes/kubernetes at the release
    of the linked `k8s.io/api` under its Apache-2.0 licence, in
    `testdata/upstream/kubernetes/` (see the next paragraph). The test walks
    the generated `SetObjectDefaults_` function of the Pod, PodTemplate,
    ReplicationController and ReplicaSet objects and every defaulting
    function they call. It fails on a field the code defaults and the list
    does not hold, on a default the list states otherwise, and on a row the
    code does not set. The walk is closed: it accepts only the kinds of
    statement, expression and type, the unary operators and the calls the
    excerpt at the vendored tag uses, each listed in the test (a method by
    its receiver's identity, a builtin only while no name of the excerpt
    shadows it), and fails on anything else, naming it and its position,
    rather than guess. It also fails on
    listed shapes it cannot follow: among others, a write through a copy of a
    field (read by name or through a dereference), a list element reached by
    anything but a range over that list, a `break` out of a loop, a method
    called on the object, a variable shadowing one of an enclosing block, or
    a write it cannot place in the object. The
    trade-off is that a re-vendoring whose code uses a new shape or call
    fails the test until that shape is understood and listed, even when it
    changes no default. Most defaults are set by a `SetDefaults_` function.
    The exceptions are a port's `protocol` and the `iscsi`, `rbd` and
    `scaleIO` strings, which `k8s.io/api` declares with a `+default` marker
    and the generated functions apply, and `hostPort`, which
    `defaultHostNetworkPorts` sets. A second test holds the numbers to the
    field comments of the linked types.

    The excerpt in `testdata/upstream/kubernetes/` holds eight files of
    kubernetes/kubernetes under its Apache-2.0 licence, each with its header,
    and kubernetes/kubernetes's `LICENSE`, the licence's full text, at the
    same tag. Its `SOURCE` file names the tag and the git blob id of each
    file and of `LICENSE`; the tests check each against its file, the tag
    against the linked `k8s.io/api`, and fail when `LICENSE` is missing. `mise run
    vendor-k8s-defaulters vX.Y.Z` re-fetches it when that module moves. CI
    never runs it, and the tests need no network.
  - A match expression without its `key` or `operator`, with an operator that
    is none of the four, or with `values` that do not go with the operator, in
    every label selector of the spec: a pod affinity or anti-affinity term's
    `labelSelector` and `namespaceSelector`, a topology spread constraint's
    `labelSelector`, a projected `clusterTrustBundle` source's `labelSelector`
    and a generic ephemeral volume's claim `selector` (see "A label selector's
    match expressions"). A node selector term is not a label selector and is
    left to the API server.

  **Marked required upstream and not checked:** the `action` of a container
  restart rule and the `operator` of its exit codes (`restartPolicyRules[]`),
  and the `signerName` and `keyType` of a pod certificate source of a
  projected volume. The Go type leaves each out when it is empty, so the Pod
  would show the omission, and launcher does not refuse it: the built-in types
  ship markers and no schema, so no linked module shows that the API server
  refuses a Pod without one, and both fields are behind a feature gate of the
  cluster. `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` lists the
  four with that reason.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` runs the check the rendered-object check runs on a
  Pod (`enforcePodTemplatePolicy`): host namespaces, hostPath volumes, the
  storage maximum on a generic ephemeral volume's claim, the registry
  allowlist on an image volume's reference, the pod-level cpu and
  memory maxima, and for every init and regular container the registry
  allowlist, the cpu and memory maxima and the privileged, HostProcess and
  capability gates. It fills no policy default: a container without resources
  stays without. The kind names a field as the property it is (`hostNetwork is
  not allowed by environment policy`, `containers[0] "app": …`); the three
  rendered paths name it under the object (`passthrough: object Pod "runner":
  spec.containers[0] "app": …`).

  **Image volumes** (go-kure/launcher#790). An image volume (`volumes[].image`)
  mounts an OCI image the kubelet pulls as it pulls a container's, so its
  `reference` is held to the allowed registries (`AllowedRegistries`), refused
  with the registry class: `volume "ext" image.reference: image
  "other.example/team/ext:1.0.0" is not from an allowed registry
  [registry.example]`. The reference is read as a container image is: one
  that names no registry host is Docker Hub's (`docker.io`), a tag or a digest
  is not part of the host, and the host must equal a list entry exactly, a
  trailing `/` on the entry aside (`registry.example:5000` is not
  `registry.example`). A volume that names no
  reference is not checked, and no list, or an empty one, allows every
  registry. The one check holds it on every path by which a document brings
  a pod spec: this kind, the pod template of `replicaset`, `replicationcontroller`,
  `podtemplate` and `cnpg-pooler`, and the pod spec of a workload that
  template delivery (`helmtemplate`), `passthrough` or a `manifests` source
  carries. The components with a volume schema of their own (`webservice`,
  `worker`, `deployment`, `statefulset`, `daemonset`, `job`, `cronjob`) take
  no image volume: their `volumes` has no such type. With the container images these
  are every field of a pod spec that names an image the kubelet pulls today.
  A test walks the linked `k8s.io/api` type and fails on a field whose name
  holds `image`, or whose type is the image volume source, that is neither
  held nor listed with a reason; an image field under another name and
  another type is not found by it. **Not covered:** a custom
  resource that `passthrough`, a `manifests` source or a chart carries passes
  whatever it holds, the pod template of a CloudNativePG Pooler and the
  extension images of a Cluster included; only the kind that builds the
  object (`cnpg-pooler`, `cnpg-cluster`) holds its fields. **Breaking:** an
  image volume naming a registry outside the list built before, on each of
  those paths, and is refused now.

  **The tag rule on an image the document names.** The reference of an image
  volume is also held to `ValidateImageRef`, as a container's image is: one
  without a tag or digest, or tagged `:latest` (with a digest too), or one
  that is no image reference, is refused, on each of the paths above
  (`volumes[0] "ext" image.reference: image "registry.example/team/ext"
  rejected: no tag or digest specified; use an explicit version tag or
  digest`; a rendered path names it under the object,
  `spec.template.spec.volumes[0] "ext" …`). The rule is the library's, not the
  environment's: the kinds apply it when the component is read and again at
  generation, with or without a policy, and the refusal carries no policy
  class. A reference by digest alone passes, and a volume that names no
  reference is not checked. The kinds that name an image outside a pod spec
  hold it to the same rule: `cnpg-pooler` its `pgbouncer.image` and the images
  of its template, `cnpg-cluster` its `imageName` and the reference of each
  extension, `postgresql` the image it composes from `version` (each in its entry).
  The test that walks the types fails on a field held to the registry rule
  and not to this one. **Breaking** (go-kure/launcher#790): a document, a
  chart or a source naming an untagged or `:latest` image in one of those
  fields built before, and is refused now. The two catalog kinds
  (`cnpg-imagecatalog`, `cnpg-clusterimagecatalog`) hold each image, component
  image and extension reference of a catalog to the rule from the release
  that adds them, so nothing that built is refused there.

  **Known difference:** template delivery (`helmtemplate`), `passthrough` and
  `manifests` do not refuse `priority` or `overhead` on a Pod they emit; the
  admission controllers decide there. They do refuse ephemeral containers and
  an untagged or `:latest` image, an image volume's included.

  The config implements `oam.ServiceAccountNamer`: the account is the authored
  `serviceAccountName`, or the deprecated `serviceAccount` where that one is
  unset, as the API server reads the two; with neither, the namespace's
  `default` account. The Pod carries the `app` label and the component label,
  and what `labels` and `annotations` author beside them.
- **replicaset** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of an
  apps/v1 ReplicaSet, on the same recipe: one schema key per json field of
  `appsv1.ReplicaSetSpec` (`replicas`, `minReadySeconds`, `selector`,
  `template`), the property map decoded strictly into that type, and one
  ReplicaSet named after the component in the build namespace, with the
  authored spec. It is the bare controller: no rollout, which a `deployment`
  component gives, and none of that kind's shorthand — a property of the
  workload kinds (`image`, `ports`, `strategy`) is refused as not a
  ReplicaSetSpec field.

  **The `app` label.** The handler adds one thing: `app: <component>` on the
  pod template's labels, beside the authored ones (see "The `app` label"). It
  is the label every workload kind gives its pods and the one launcher's
  traits and Services select on, so a `networkpolicy` trait's policy and a
  `service` component with `selector: {app: <component>}` reach the pods. The
  selector is emitted as authored, and the ReplicaSet itself gets no label of
  the handler's; the transform then sets the component label on the object and
  its template, as on every object a component owns (go-kure/launcher#788).
  - An authored `template.metadata.labels.app` with the component's own label
    value is kept. Any other value is refused, naming the component
    (``template.metadata.labels.app: "frontend" is not the `app` label of
    component "web" ("web")``): the label cannot say something else than what
    the traits select.
  - A selector that matches the authored template labels and would stop
    matching once the label is added (`app` under `DoesNotExist`, or `NotIn`
    the label value) is refused (``selector: rules out the label `app: web`
    …``). A selector on `app: <component>` is satisfied by the added label, so
    the template needs no label of its own for it. A selector that cannot be
    read as one (an expression without its `key` or `operator`, an unknown
    operator, `values` that do not go with the operator, a key or value that
    is no label) cannot be compared and is refused with apimachinery's reason
    (`selector: …`). That covers what "A label selector's match expressions"
    lists, so this selector is not read a second time.

  **Traits.** A trait target as the `pod` kind is: `security-context`, a
  `configmap` trait's `mountPath` and an `external-secret` trait's
  `envFrom`/`mountPath` change its pod template. `topology-spread` and
  `scaler` are not available on it.

  **Refused when the component is read**, with or without a policy:
  - An unauthored `selector`. The Go type cannot omit it, so it would be
    written as `null`, and launcher derives none. Whether it matches the
    template's labels, like the API's other value rules (an empty selector,
    `restartPolicy` other than `Always`, a negative `replicas`), is left to
    the API server.
  - Under `template.spec`, what the `pod` kind refuses of its own spec, by the
    same checks and named by path (`template.spec.containers: required`,
    `template.spec.priority: not authorable …`, the image rule, a probe timing
    written as `0`, a defaulted string written as `""`, a `hostPort` of `0`
    under `hostNetwork`, a defective match expression in a label selector of
    the pod spec). A test holds the probe list to every non-pointer
    `omitempty` number or boolean under `ReplicaSetSpec` whose field comment
    states a non-zero default, the template's metadata included, and
    `TestKubernetesDefaulters_MatchVendoredSource` holds the whole list to
    the API server's defaulting code for a ReplicaSet.
  - `template.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`. The API server forbids it on a
    ReplicaSet's pod template, whose pods are replaced for as long as the
    controller exists; a `pod` or a Job may set it.

  The two restart-rule fields and the two pod-certificate fields that are
  marked required upstream are not checked under `template.spec` either, for
  the reason the `pod` kind gives: no linked module shows that the API server
  refuses the omission.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` holds `replicas` to the replica maximum, an unset
  one as the 1 the API server defaults it to (`replicas 4 exceeds enforced
  maximum 3`), and the pod template to the check the `pod` kind runs
  (`enforcePodTemplatePolicy`), naming a field by its path in the properties
  (`template.spec: hostNetwork is not allowed by environment policy`,
  `template.spec.containers[0] "app": …`). It fills no policy default: an
  unset `replicas` stays unset and a container without resources stays
  without. The three rendered paths run the same checks on a ReplicaSet they
  emit and name the field under the object (`spec.replicas`,
  `spec.template.spec…`).

  **Known difference:** template delivery (`helmtemplate`), `passthrough` and
  `manifests` do not refuse `priority`, `overhead` or `activeDeadlineSeconds`
  on a ReplicaSet they emit, do not require a selector and add no `app` label;
  the API server decides there. They do refuse ephemeral containers and an
  untagged or `:latest` image, an image volume's included.

  The config implements `oam.ServiceAccountNamer`, reading the template's
  `serviceAccountName` as the `pod` kind reads its own. The ReplicaSet's own
  labels and annotations are the `labels` and `annotations` properties; the
  template's metadata is carried as authored and takes neither.
- **replicationcontroller** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named
  projection of a v1 ReplicationController, on the `replicaset` kind's recipe:
  one schema key per json field of `corev1.ReplicationControllerSpec`
  (`replicas`, `minReadySeconds`, `selector`, `template`), the property map
  decoded strictly into that type, and one ReplicationController named after
  the component in the build namespace, with the authored spec. What the
  `replicaset` kind states holds here — the `app` label on the pod template
  and the refusal of an authored one with another value, the three traits, the
  refusals under `template.spec` (`activeDeadlineSeconds` included), the two
  restart-rule fields and the two pod-certificate fields that are marked
  required upstream and are not checked, because no linked module shows that
  the API server refuses the omission, the
  replica maximum and the pod-template policy check, no policy default, the
  known difference of the three rendered paths, `oam.ServiceAccountNamer`, and
  `labels` and `annotations` for the object's own metadata — with these
  differences:
  - `selector` is a plain map of label to value, not a label selector: a
    `matchLabels` or `matchExpressions` key is refused as not a
    ReplicationControllerSpec field.
  - `selector` is optional. An unset one stays unset, and the API server
    defaults it to the pod template's labels, the `app` label included.
  - `template` is required (`template: required`). The API type holds it by
    pointer, so an unauthored one would be emitted without pods to create.
  - No selector is refused against the `app` label: a map selector asks only
    for labels to be present, which a further label on the pods cannot break.
- **podtemplate** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a v1
  PodTemplate. The object has no spec: beside its identity it holds one field,
  `template`, and that is the component's one property, decoded strictly into
  `corev1.PodTemplateSpec`. It emits one PodTemplate named after the component
  in the build namespace, with the authored template. Any other property is
  refused, the object's own `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` included
  (`properties do not decode into a v1 PodTemplate …`).

  **It is stored, not run.** No controller creates pods from a PodTemplate, so
  the handler adds no `app` label to the template (an authored `app` label is
  carried as written), the config reports no ServiceAccount
  (`oam.ServiceAccountNamer` is not implemented, so an `rbac` trait binds the
  component name), and it is not a trait target: a `configmap` trait's
  `mountPath`, an `external-secret` trait's `envFrom`/`mountPath` and a
  `security-context` trait's pod-spec properties (`runAsUser` and the five
  others) are refused on it, naming the component and the kinds they apply
  to. `security-context` with `psaLevel` alone is accepted, as a declaration
  of the level, and writes nothing to the template
  (go-kure/launcher#794, item 14; `pkg/oam/builtin/traits/README.md`,
  "Pod-spec traits on a component without a workload"). The transform still sets the
  component label on the object and its template, as on every object a
  component owns (go-kure/launcher#788).

  **Refused when the component is read**, with or without a policy: under
  `template.spec`, what the `pod` kind refuses of its own spec, by the same
  checks and named by path (`template.spec.containers: required`, which an
  unauthored `template` also gives; `template.spec.priority: not authorable
  …`; the image rule; a probe timing written as `0`; a defaulted string
  written as `""`; a `hostPort` of `0` under `hostNetwork`, which the API
  server would replace in each pod created from the template; a defective
  match expression in a label selector of the pod spec).
  `template.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` is allowed, unlike on a
  `replicaset` or `replicationcontroller`: the API server accepts it on a
  PodTemplate. The two restart-rule fields and the two pod-certificate fields
  that are marked required upstream are not checked, for the reason the `pod`
  kind gives: no linked module shows that the API server refuses the
  omission. The API's other value rules are left to the API server.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` holds the template to the check the `pod` kind
  runs (`enforcePodTemplatePolicy`), naming a field by its path in the
  properties (`template.spec: hostNetwork is not allowed by environment
  policy`), since whatever reads the template creates pods from it. It fills
  no policy default. The three rendered paths run the same check on a
  PodTemplate they emit and name the field the same way (`template.spec…`).

  **Known difference:** template delivery (`helmtemplate`), `passthrough` and
  `manifests` do not refuse `priority` or `overhead` on a PodTemplate they
  emit; the API server decides there. They do refuse ephemeral containers and
  an untagged or `:latest` image, an image volume's included. The PodTemplate's
  own labels and annotations
  are the `labels` and `annotations` properties; the template's metadata is
  carried as authored and takes neither.
- **storageclass**, **volumeattributesclass**, **priorityclass**,
  **runtimeclass**, **ingressclass**, **csidriver** (go-kure/launcher#790) are
  the kind-named projections of six cluster-scoped objects: a
  `storage.k8s.io/v1` StorageClass, VolumeAttributesClass and CSIDriver, a
  `scheduling.k8s.io/v1` PriorityClass, a `node.k8s.io/v1` RuntimeClass and a
  `networking.k8s.io/v1` IngressClass. Each emits that one object, named after
  the component unless `objectName` names it, with no namespace, holding
  exactly what was authored: the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default of its own, and the transform sets the component label, as on every
  object a component owns (go-kure/launcher#788).

  **One shared helper builds all six** (`policyFreeKind`, in
  `kind_policy_free.go`), for a kind to which no dimension of the environment
  policy applies; `servicecidr`, `poddisruptionbudget`, `endpointslice`, the four kinds of
  the RBAC API, the four of the Prometheus operator's API, the four of Cilium's
  BGP control plane and the five kinds of the Gateway API's infrastructure
  objects are built on it too. The three kinds
  of cert-manager's API, the two of VolSync's and `alertmanager` are built on `policyHeldKind`
  (`kind_policy_held.go`): this helper, unchanged, with an `ApplyPolicy` that
  asks one function of the kind whether the policy refuses the decoded value.
  It refuses or passes; it fills no default. A kind is a value
  of it naming the upstream type, an optional check of required fields, an
  optional list of required fields the type writes whether or not they were
  authored, and the base-library constructor; the
  helper is the rest: the strict decode of the property map into the upstream
  type under the package's null contract, which refuses a `null` list element
  by its path (`decodeKindSpec`), the refusal of a key written in two
  spellings (`refuseUncarriedSpecValues`), the refusal of a listed required
  field that was not authored (`refuseUnauthoredRequired`, which reads the
  authored properties, since the decoded value does not show the omission, and
  follows a list to each of its items), a config whose `ApplyPolicy` does
  nothing, and a `Generate` that returns the constructor's object, under the
  object name the config carries, with a deep copy of what was decoded, so two
  builds of one config share nothing. The config type is unexported: a
  component is only built from properties that went through the decode. A
  kind may list its defaulted zeros (`defaultedZeros`), and an authored `0`,
  `false` or `""` on a listed field is refused, as the secret-store kinds do
  (see the **secretstore** entry) and `alertmanager` does for the probes of the
  containers it lists and three strings of its own. A kind that lists none suits a type only
  when none of its omit-when-zero numbers or booleans has a non-zero API
  default; `TestPolicyFreeKinds_NoDefaultedZeros` reads the field comments of
  every Kubernetes type built on it and fails on one whose comment states such
  a default in a form it recognises (`Defaults to 1`, `Default is true`). A
  default the comment words otherwise, or does not state, is not found, and
  a string's default is not read from a comment. The types of the Prometheus
  operator's API publish no field comment; `TestMonitoringKinds_DefaultedZeros`
  reads the default markers of their source instead, strings included. Cilium's publish none either, and its module ships the CRDs:
  `TestCiliumBGPKinds_DefaultsSitOnPointers` holds every default of the four
  BGP CRDs to a field that is a pointer in the Go type.

  **Authored empty lists the API defaults.** A defaulted-zero list may also
  hold a list the type omits when empty, and an authored `[]` there is
  refused the same way (`metrics: [] cannot be carried by the Kubernetes API
  types (the field is omitted when empty, so the API server would apply its
  default …)`). Three lists are refused: a `horizontalpodautoscaler`'s
  `metrics` and its scaling rules' `policies`, and a `networkpolicy`'s
  `policyTypes`. Two lists the API defaults are not refused, because an
  empty list already means their default: `csidriver`'s
  `volumeLifecycleModes` (an empty list means `Persistent`) and
  `imagerepository`'s `exclusionList` (the image-reflector controller
  filters tags through `GetExclusionList`, which returns the default list
  when the list is empty, so an API client's `[]` means the default too). `TestKindComponents_DefaultedEmptyLists` walks every
  kind in its table of API sources, finds each list omitted when empty that
  its source gives a default (a CRD schema or a default marker) or whose
  field comment mentions a default, and holds each to an answer: refused,
  or not refused with the reason. A newly defaulted list fails it until it
  is answered. The three refused defaults are held to the API server's
  defaulting code by `TestKubernetesDefaulters_ListDefaultsMatchVendoredSource`,
  from the excerpt the `pod` kind's list is held to: the functions that
  reach those defaults are held to their exact statements, and each default
  to being the only write to its field or to anything beneath it. Two limits: the lists
  of the Kubernetes types are found from their field comments, so a list
  the API server defaults without its comment saying so is not found; and
  the table of kinds it walks is not itself proven to hold every kind
  component.

  **What is authored.**
  - `ingressclass` and `csidriver` have a spec type, and the properties are
    its json fields: `controller` and `parameters` (`IngressClassSpec`), and
    the eleven fields of `CSIDriverSpec` (`attachRequired`, `podInfoOnMount`,
    `volumeLifecycleModes`, `storageCapacity`, `fsGroupPolicy`,
    `tokenRequests`, `requiresRepublish`, `seLinuxMount`,
    `nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds`, `serviceAccountTokenInSecrets`,
    `preventPodSchedulingIfMissing`). A `csidriver` requires no property; an
    `ingressclass` requires `controller` (see **Required** below).
  - The four classes have none: their fields sit on the object, beside its
    identity. The properties are those fields, decoded strictly into the
    object type, and the object's own `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` are
    refused by name under any spelling the decoder would match (`metadata:
    not authorable: launcher sets the object's kind, apiVersion and metadata
    (its name is the component's, or the one objectName gives it; its labels
    and annotations are the labels and annotations properties)`).
    `storageclass`: `provisioner`,
    `parameters`, `reclaimPolicy`, `mountOptions`, `allowVolumeExpansion`,
    `volumeBindingMode`, `allowedTopologies`. `volumeattributesclass`:
    `driverName`, `parameters`. `priorityclass`: `value`, `globalDefault`,
    `description`, `preemptionPolicy`. `runtimeclass`: `handler`, `overhead`,
    `scheduling`.
  - **Required** is a top-level field the API server refuses an object
    without: `provisioner` (`storageclass`), `handler` (`runtimeclass`),
    `driverName` (`volumeattributesclass`) and `controller` (`ingressclass`)
    must be a non-empty string (`provisioner: required …`), and a
    `volumeattributesclass` must carry at least one of `parameters`
    (`parameters: required …`). The upstream type marks `controller`
    optional; the API server's validation requires it all the same. The API
    does not require a PriorityClass `value`: the type always encodes one, so
    a `priorityclass` that authors none is emitted with `value: 0`. Every
    other value rule (which reclaim policies exist, a required field of a
    nested object, the names a cluster-scoped object may carry) is left to
    the API server.
  - A quantity written as a number is emitted in its canonical string form.
    An authored `false` or `0` is kept where the API tells it from an unset
    field (`allowVolumeExpansion: false`, `attachRequired: false`,
    `value: 0`). Where the API type omits a zero, the field is left out of
    the object, which the API reads as the same value: `globalDefault: false`
    and an empty `description`.

  **The object's name** is the component's unless `objectName`, or the
  `Naming` hook under role `object`, names it otherwise (see "The object name"
  below). Each handler declares its object as cluster-scoped, so the name is
  claimed in no namespace: two `storageclass` components given one object
  name are refused, whatever namespace the application is built for. What
  refers to the object names it by its object name: a claim's
  `storageClassName`, a pod's `runtimeClassName` or `priorityClassName`. The
  API identifies a CSI driver by the CSIDriver's name, so a `csidriver`
  component's object name must be the driver's (`csi.example.com`), written as
  the component name or as `objectName`. The build namespace does not apply to
  these objects. The handlers check no name rule of their own on either name:
  one the API server refuses for the kind builds here and is refused at
  apply. **A CSIDriver's name is not held to the limit the API documents for
  it.** The type's documentation gives a driver name at most 63 characters;
  the API server does not hold the CSIDriver object to that, and accepts any
  DNS subdomain name. It does refuse a PersistentVolume that names a driver
  longer than 63 characters, so such a CSIDriver is created and no volume can
  use it. The `csidriver` kind refuses what the API server refuses of the
  object and no more, so it builds that name too.

  **Policy.** None of the six has a field an `oam.Policy` method speaks to,
  so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and each builds the
  same under every policy and under none. A consumer that does not want an
  author to create one of these objects does not register its handler; the
  transform then refuses the component (`no handler for component type …`).

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties,
  on all six. That includes the annotations that mark a default class
  (`storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`,
  `ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class`): a default StorageClass or
  IngressClass writes its annotation there. Whether a second default exists
  is the cluster's to decide.

  **Not covered.**
  - An `ingressclass` whose `parameters` leaves `scope` out is emitted with
    `scope: null`: the API type always encodes the field, and documents
    `Cluster` as its default. Author `scope` to emit a value.
  - Whether a referenced object exists: the `runtimeclass` a pod names, the
    `storageclass` a claim names, the parameters object of an `ingressclass`.
- **ingress** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a
  networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress, on the recipe of `resourcequota`: one
  schema key per json field of `networkingv1.IngressSpec` (`ingressClassName`,
  `defaultBackend`, `tls`, `rules`), the property map decoded strictly into
  that type under the null contract, two spellings of one field refused, and
  `TestCoreKindSchemas_CoverSpec` holding the schema to the linked type. It
  emits one Ingress named after the component in the build namespace, with the
  authored spec and nothing else. No field is required by the decode and none
  is filled: an Ingress with neither a `defaultBackend` nor a rule, a path
  without a `pathType` and the API's other value rules are left to the API
  server. A null list element (`rules: [null]`, a null path or TLS entry) is
  refused by its path.

  **It is an authored object, not the `ingress` trait**, although the two
  share the type name. The trait attaches to a component and routes to that
  component's Service; this kind is a component of its own, and a backend is a
  Service reference carried as written. Three things the trait has do not
  reach it:
  - **No NetworkPolicy allow rule.** The NetworkPolicy synthesis opens a
    backend's port to the ingress controller from what a routing trait reports
    (the traffic sources capability rendering gives it, and the component it
    targets). This kind reports neither, so the synthesis reads nothing from
    it and allows nothing for it, whatever Service it names. An author who
    wants the allow rule puts the `expose` or `ingress` trait on the backend
    component, or authors the NetworkPolicy (the `networkpolicy` trait or
    kind).
  - **No hostname constraint.** The platform's `allowedHostnameWildcard`, which
    the trait holds every hostname to, is a trait rendering input. A host
    authored here is not checked against it.
  - **No environment policy.** `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op: the policy has no rule
    for an Ingress, and its capability lists (`AllowedCapabilities`,
    `ForbiddenCapabilities`, `RequiredCapabilities`) gate trait types, so a
    policy that forbids the `ingress` trait does not refuse an `ingress`
    component. `passthrough`, `manifests` and template delivery emit an Ingress
    under the same terms. A consumer that restricts routing restricts the
    component types it registers.

  **The name** is the component's, or its `objectName` ("The object name"
  below). An `ingress` trait names its own Ingress (`<component>-ingress`, or
  its `name`); a component and a trait whose Ingress would carry one name are
  refused, with both named.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties, a
  controller's `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/…` annotations among them.
  **Not covered:** its `status`, which the controller writes.
- **httproute** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a
  gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 HTTPRoute, on the same recipe as `ingress`: one
  schema key per json field of `gatewayv1.HTTPRouteSpec`, those of the
  `CommonRouteSpec` it inlines included (`parentRefs`, `useDefaultGateways`,
  `hostnames`, `rules`), decoded strictly into that type. No type under
  `HTTPRouteSpec` unmarshals itself, so an unknown key is refused at every
  depth. It emits one HTTPRoute named after the component in the build
  namespace, with the authored spec and nothing else. No field is required by
  the decode and none is filled; the API's value rules (a filter's `type`
  matching the member set, a rule's `matches` and `backendRefs` limits) are
  left to the API server. A null list element (`rules: [null]`, a null parent
  or backendRef) is refused by its path. `useDefaultGateways` is a field of the
  Gateway API's experimental channel: the standard channel's HTTPRoute CRD
  does not hold it, so a cluster on that channel does not keep it.

  **It is an authored object, not the `httproute` trait**, although the two
  share the type name. The trait attaches to a component and routes to that
  component's Service; this kind is a component of its own, and a backendRef is
  a reference carried as written, its `namespace` included. Three things the
  trait has do not reach it:
  - **No NetworkPolicy allow rule.** As for `ingress`: the NetworkPolicy
    synthesis reads a routing trait's traffic sources and target component,
    which this kind does not report, so it allows nothing for the route's
    backends. An author who wants the allow rule puts the `expose` or
    `httproute` trait on the backend component, or authors the NetworkPolicy.
  - **No parent from a capability.** The trait builds `parentRefs` from the
    Gateway its capability rendering names when the author writes none. Here
    `parentRefs` is what the author wrote; unwritten, the route has no parent.
  - **No environment policy.** `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op, and the policy's
    capability lists gate trait types, so a policy that forbids the
    `httproute` trait does not refuse an `httproute` component. `passthrough`,
    `manifests` and template delivery emit an HTTPRoute under the same terms.
    A consumer that restricts routing restricts the component types it
    registers.

  **The name** is the component's, or its `objectName`. An `httproute` trait
  names its own HTTPRoute (`<component>-httproute`, or its `name`); a
  component and a trait whose HTTPRoute would carry one name are refused, with
  both named.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  **Not covered:** its `status`, which the Gateway controller writes.
- **grpcroute** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a
  gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1 GRPCRoute, on the `httproute` kind's recipe and
  not on `policyFreeKind` as the TCP, UDP and TLS routes are: one schema key
  per json field of `gatewayv1.GRPCRouteSpec` (`parentRefs`,
  `useDefaultGateways`, `hostnames`, `rules`), decoded strictly into that
  type, and one GRPCRoute emitted in the build namespace, named after the
  component unless `objectName` names it. The API requires no rule, backend or
  hostname of a GRPCRoute, as of an HTTPRoute, so the decode requires none and
  fills none; the API's value rules are left to the API server. A null list
  element is refused by its path. Parent and backend references are carried
  as written, their `namespace` included. As for `httproute`, no NetworkPolicy
  allow rule is synthesized for its backends, no parent comes from a
  capability, and `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op. Its required fields written
  unauthored and not refused are listed under [Required fields a kind writes
  unauthored and does not refuse](#required-fields-a-kind-writes-unauthored-and-does-not-refuse).

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  **Not covered:** its `status`, which the Gateway controller writes.
- **networkpolicy** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a
  networking.k8s.io/v1 NetworkPolicy, on the same recipe as `ingress`: one
  schema key per json field of `networkingv1.NetworkPolicySpec` (`podSelector`,
  `ingress`, `egress`, `policyTypes`), decoded strictly into that type. It
  emits one NetworkPolicy named after the component in the build namespace,
  with the authored spec and nothing else. No top-level field is required and
  none is filled. A match expression of `podSelector`, or of a peer's
  `podSelector` or `namespaceSelector`, is refused without its `key` or
  `operator`, with an operator that is none of the four, or with `values` that
  do not go with the operator (see "A label selector's match expressions");
  the config is exported, so `Generate` repeats what the typed spec can show.
  The API's other value rules (a peer naming at least one of `podSelector`,
  `namespaceSelector` and `ipBlock`, an `ipBlock` beside no selector, a valid
  CIDR, a label key's syntax) are left to the API server.

  **The spec reads as the API reads it, which is not how the `networkpolicy`
  trait reads the same keys.** The two share the type name; the trait attaches
  to a component and scopes the policy to that component's pods, and this kind
  is a component of its own that scopes nothing:
  - **`podSelector` is not defaulted.** The trait has no such property: it
    always selects its component's pods. Here an unwritten `podSelector`, like
    `{}`, is the empty selector: **the policy applies to every pod of the
    namespace**. An author moving a policy from the trait to the kind writes
    the selector out.
  - **`policyTypes` is not derived.** The trait has no such property either: it
    lists a direction when that direction's key is present, so its `egress: []`
    denies all egress. Here `policyTypes` is what the author wrote; unwritten,
    the API server derives it: `Ingress` always, `Egress` only when `egress`
    holds a rule. So on the kind `egress: []` alone isolates no egress; a
    policy that denies all egress writes `policyTypes: [Egress]`. An authored
    `policyTypes: []` is refused: the type omits it, and the API server would
    derive it as above (`policyTypes: [] cannot be carried by the Kubernetes
    API types (…)`).
  - **An empty rule allows everything in its direction.** `ingress: [{}]` is
    the API's allow-all, and is carried when written. It is never the result
    of a null: a null rule, peer or port (`ingress: [null]`,
    `from: [null]`) is refused by its path, since decoded it would be the
    empty, allow-all one. An empty `ingress` or `egress` list is carried as an
    unwritten one, which the API reads the same way.
  - **A selector picks pods by label.** A peer's `podSelector` is not a
    component reference and nothing resolves it; the label a workload
    component's pods carry is described under "The `app` label" below.
  - **No environment policy.** `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op, and the policy's
    capability lists gate trait types, so a policy that forbids the
    `networkpolicy` trait does not refuse a `networkpolicy` component.
    `passthrough`, `manifests` and template delivery emit a NetworkPolicy
    under the same terms. A consumer that restricts network policy restricts
    the component types it registers.

  The transform's NetworkPolicy synthesis does not read this kind: it neither
  counts an authored policy as covering a component nor merges into it, and
  the policies it emits (`{comp}-allow-ingress-traffic` and the others) are
  additive beside it. **The name** is the component's, or its `objectName`; a
  component whose policy would carry the name of a `networkpolicy` trait's
  (`<component>-allow`, or its `name`) or of a synthesized one is refused, with
  both named. The NetworkPolicy's own labels and annotations are the `labels`
  and `annotations` properties.
- **cilium-networkpolicy** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection
  of a cilium.io/v2 CiliumNetworkPolicy. The object has no spec type of its
  own: it holds one rule under `spec`, a list of rules under `specs`, or both,
  each a Cilium `api.Rule`. The component's properties are those two fields,
  decoded strictly into that type under the null contract, and
  `TestCoreKindSchemas_CoverSpec` holds the two keys to the linked
  `CiliumNetworkPolicy` type. It emits one CiliumNetworkPolicy named after the
  component in the build namespace, with the authored rules and nothing else.
  The whole rule is authorable: `endpointSelector`, `ingress`, `ingressDeny`,
  `egress`, `egressDeny`, `labels`, `enableDefaultDeny`, `description`, `log`.

  **Refused at build, because Cilium rejects the policy.** Its CRD schema
  refuses some of these at admission (a rule with no selector, or without any of
  the four rule keys); the rest the API server stores and the agent rejects when
  it reads the object, so that nothing enforces it. Launcher refuses all of them
  instead of emitting the object:
  - no rule at all: neither `spec` nor an entry in `specs`. An empty `specs`
    holds none; beside a `spec` it is accepted and not emitted;
  - a rule with no `endpointSelector`. None is filled in: `{}` selects every
    endpoint of the namespace and is carried as written, and a null or absent
    one is refused;
  - a rule with a `nodeSelector`, which belongs to a
    CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy and which Cilium rejects in a namespaced
    policy;
  - a rule with no entry in any of `ingress`, `ingressDeny`, `egress` and
    `egressDeny`. A deny list counts as much as an allow list; a null or empty
    list holds no entry.

  These are the checks Cilium's own reader makes that need no agent
  configuration; the code names the Cilium functions they mirror. The rest of
  a rule's value rules (a port's range, an entity's name, which peers may be
  combined) are left to Cilium. A null list element (`specs: [null]`, a null
  ingress entry or peer) is refused by its path.

  **Required.** Inside a rule the CRD requires 59 fields that the Cilium type
  writes whether or not they were authored, so that the object would not show
  the omission: a match expression without its `operator` was emitted as
  `operator: ""`, an `authentication: {}` as `mode: ""`, a `terminatingTLS: {}`
  as `secret: null`, each of which the API server refuses. Each is refused
  where its parent is authored, by its path
  (`spec.ingress[0].authentication.mode: required (…)`):
  - the `key` and `operator` of a match expression, in every selector of a
    rule (`endpointSelector`, `fromEndpoints`, `toEndpoints`, `fromNodes`,
    `toNodes`, a CIDR entry's `cidrGroupSelector`, a `k8sServiceSelector`'s
    `selector`), under the deny lists too;
  - a `k8sServiceSelector`'s `selector`, the `key` of a rule label and the
    `type` of an `icmps` field;
  - under an allow list only: an `authentication`'s `mode`; a port's
    `listener` `name`, its `envoyConfig` and that configuration's `name`; the
    `secret` of a port's `terminatingTLS` and `originatingTLS` and that
    Secret's `name`; an HTTP header match's `name`, and the `name` of its
    `secret` where one is authored.

  Two more are optional to the API and required here: a listener's `priority`
  and the `kind` of its `envoyConfig`. The type writes an unauthored one as
  `0` and as the empty string, and the API refuses both (a priority is 1 to
  100, a kind is `CiliumEnvoyConfig` or `CiliumClusterwideEnvoyConfig`), so a
  listener that leaves one out cannot be emitted.
  `TestCiliumNetworkPolicy_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the whole list to the
  CiliumNetworkPolicy CRD of the linked module, its own file and not the
  cluster-wide policy's, and to the rule type, under `spec` and under `specs`,
  so a dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails there. The CRD
  names a `nodeSelector`'s match expressions as well, and so does the list: an
  incomplete one is refused by this rule, a complete one by the rule above. A
  rule label without its `key` is refused earlier, by Cilium's own decoding,
  as an `icmps` field without its `type` is (below). An authored empty value
  in a required field is not checked: it is the API server's to refuse. The
  list of a rule is held in the internal `pkg/oam/internal/requiredfields`
  (`CiliumRule`), since the `cilium-networkpolicy` trait reads it too, cut to
  the three fields of a rule it publishes.

  **An unknown key inside a selector is refused**, by its path
  (`spec.ingress[0].fromEndpoints[1].matchLabel: unknown field`). Cilium's
  endpoint selector unmarshals itself and drops a key it does not know, which
  the strict decode cannot see: `endpointSelector: {matchLabel: {...}}` would be
  the empty selector, which selects every endpoint of the namespace, and a peer
  misspelt the same way would match every endpoint. The check covers every
  position that holds a selector (`endpointSelector`, `fromEndpoints`,
  `toEndpoints`, `fromNodes`, `toNodes`, a CIDR entry's `cidrGroupSelector`,
  under the deny lists too) and the two other types under a rule that unmarshal
  themselves: an `icmps` field (`family`, `type`) and an entry of `labels` in
  its object form (`key`, `value`, `source`). The positions are found from the
  Cilium types, and a test fails when a Cilium bump adds a type that unmarshals
  itself and is not checked.

  **An `icmps` field needs its `type`.** Cilium's own decoding of the field
  panics when `type` is absent or null; the component is refused with an error
  that names the panic (`… the decoder of … panicked on this value: …`) and not
  the field's position, so look for an `icmps` field without a `type`.

  **It is an authored object, not the `cilium-networkpolicy` trait**, although
  the two share the type name. The trait attaches to a component and publishes
  one rule's `name`, `endpointSelector`, `ingress` and `egress`; this kind is a
  component of its own, named after the component or by its `objectName`, and
  publishes the whole rule and `specs`. A component and a trait whose policy
  would carry one name (the trait's `name`) are refused, with both named.
  Neither fills a selector. **No environment policy
  applies:** `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op, and the policy's capability lists gate
  trait types, so a policy that forbids the `cilium-networkpolicy` trait does
  not refuse a `cilium-networkpolicy` component. `passthrough`, `manifests`
  and template delivery emit a CiliumNetworkPolicy under the same terms. A
  consumer that restricts network policy restricts the component types it
  registers. **No literal secret is checked:** an HTTP header match's `value`
  is written into the object as authored and is not refused, since a header
  value cannot be told from a credential; a header match's `secret` refers to
  a Secret by name and keeps the value out of the document. The object's own
  labels and annotations are the top-level
  `labels` and `annotations` properties; a `labels` under `spec` or a `specs`
  entry is the rule's own field. **Not covered:** its `status`, which the
  Cilium agent writes.
- **servicecidr** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a
  cluster-scoped `networking.k8s.io/v1` ServiceCIDR: a range the API server
  assigns Service cluster IPs from, beside the one it was started with. It is
  built on `policyFreeKind`, as the six kinds of the **storageclass** entry
  are, and what that entry
  says of them holds here: one object, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it, with no namespace, declared cluster-scoped, holding
  exactly what was authored, the same under every policy and under none.
  - **Authored:** the one field of `ServiceCIDRSpec`, `cidrs`, a list of IP
    blocks in CIDR notation, decoded strictly. **Required:** at least one
    block (`cidrs: required …`); the API server refuses a ServiceCIDR
    without one. Every other value rule is left to the API server: that a
    block is a valid CIDR, that there are at most two, and that two are of
    different IP families.
  - **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  - **Not covered.** The API server refuses a change to a block once the
    object exists; a ServiceCIDR of one block may only gain a second.
    Launcher does not compare a build with the cluster, so a changed block
    builds here and is refused at apply. The object's status is the API
    server's and is not written.
- **poddisruptionbudget** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection
  of a `policy/v1` PodDisruptionBudget, built on `policyFreeKind`. It emits
  that one object in the build namespace, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it, holding exactly what was authored: the handler adds
  no label, no annotation and no default of its own. The handler declares its
  object as namespaced, so the object name is claimed in the object's namespace.
  - **Authored:** the four fields of `PodDisruptionBudgetSpec`, decoded
    strictly: `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` (each a count or a
    percentage string such as `"50%"`), `selector` (a label selector) and
    `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy`. A count is emitted as a number and a
    percentage as a string, and an authored `0` is kept (`maxUnavailable: 0`
    allows no voluntary eviction).
  - **Required:** no top-level field. The API server accepts a budget with an
    empty spec. Inside `selector`, a match expression is refused without its
    `key` or `operator`, with an operator that is none of the four, or with
    `values` that do not go with the operator (see "A label selector's match
    expressions"). The API's other value rules are left to it, the one that
    `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` exclude each other included: a
    component that authors both builds here and is refused at apply.
  - **The selector is the author's.** Launcher points it at no component: an
    unauthored `selector` selects no pod, and `selector: {}` selects every
    pod of the namespace. To cover a workload component, select its `app`
    label (`matchLabels: {app: <component>}`), which holds the component
    name up to 63 characters and its label projection beyond.
  - **Beside the `scaler` trait.** `scaler` with `enablePDB: true` derives a
    budget for its own workload, selector included, and refuses one that
    would block every eviction. This kind is the authored object and applies
    none of that: it is for a budget the trait does not express (the trait
    always writes `minAvailable: 50%`; here the count or percentage is the
    author's, as are `maxUnavailable`, an eviction policy and pods launcher
    does not own).
  - **Policy.** No field of the spec is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to,
    so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing.
  - **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  - **Not covered.** Whether the selector matches any pod. The object's
    status is the disruption controller's and is not written.
- **endpointslice** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named projection of a
  `discovery.k8s.io/v1` EndpointSlice, built on `policyFreeKind`. It emits
  that one object in the build namespace, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it, holding exactly what was authored: the handler adds
  no label, no annotation and no default of its own. The handler declares its
  object as namespaced, so the object name is claimed in the object's namespace.
  - **Authored:** an EndpointSlice has no spec, so the properties are the
    object's own top-level fields, decoded strictly at every depth:
    `addressType`, `endpoints` and `ports`. The object's `kind`, `apiVersion`
    and `metadata` are launcher's and are refused under any spelling. An
    authored `false` is kept (`conditions: {ready: false}`), and an
    endpoint's `deprecatedTopology` is written as authored, though the type
    documents that the v1 API ignores a write to it.
  - **Its Service is a label, and the label is the author's literal.** A
    slice belongs to a Service only through its `kubernetes.io/service-name`
    label, authored under `labels`. Launcher derives the label from nothing
    and points it at no component: it does not follow a `service` component's
    `objectName`, so write the name the Service object takes. A slice without
    the label builds and belongs to no Service. A `service` component of a
    type other than `ExternalName` always carries a selector (the kind
    refuses an empty one, and an `ExternalName` Service has no endpoints),
    so a Service whose endpoints are all written by hand comes from
    elsewhere: a `manifests` component, or outside the document.
  - **Required** are the fields the API's source marks required and the Go
    type writes whether or not they were authored, so that the built object
    would not show the omission: `addressType` (`addressType: required …`),
    an endpoint's `addresses` (`endpoints[0].addresses: required …`), and the
    `name` of an entry of an endpoint's `hints.forZones` or `hints.forNodes`.
    `TestBuiltinMarkerKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers` derives the list from the
    `+required` and `+optional` markers of the linked `k8s.io/api` module and
    fails on a dependency bump that changes it. The API marks no field of the
    kind required that the type leaves out when unauthored; the same test
    fails if one appears. `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults`
    holds the kind in its table as well, from the same markers: to that, and
    to no default marked on a field the type writes unauthored. The check is
    one of presence: an authored empty value (`addressType: ""`,
    `addresses: []`) builds and is the API server's to refuse.
  - **Emitted empty.** The type writes three fields the API does not require
    whether or not they were authored. A slice that authors no `endpoints` or
    no `ports` carries `endpoints: null` or `ports: null`, an authored empty
    list is written as `[]`, and an endpoint that authors no condition
    carries `conditions: {}`. A port that authors no `protocol` or no `name`
    is written without it, and the API server fills `TCP` and the empty
    name.
  - **Not artifact sources.** The addresses of an endpoint, FQDNs included,
    are where traffic goes, not an artifact source, and none is held to the
    policy's allowed registries.
  - **Policy.** No field of the object is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks
    to, so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing.
  - **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  - **Not covered.** Every rule on the form of a value is left to the API
    server: that an address is of the slice's `addressType`, the limits the
    type documents on how many endpoints, addresses, ports and hints a slice
    holds, and the names of ports. The type documents `addressType` as
    immutable. Launcher does not compare a build with the cluster, so a
    changed one builds here and is refused at apply. Whether a Service of
    the labelled name exists is not checked.
- **role**, **rolebinding**, **clusterrole**, **clusterrolebinding**
  (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections of the four objects
  of the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` API, built on `policyFreeKind`. Each
  emits that one object, named after the component unless `objectName` names
  it, holding exactly what was authored: the handler adds no label, no
  annotation and no default of its own. They are for the grants an
  application needs that are not those of one workload's own ServiceAccount,
  which is what the `rbac` trait (`pkg/oam/builtin/traits/README.md`)
  writes: a role several bindings share, a binding to a role that already
  exists, a grant to a user or a group, an aggregated ClusterRole. What the
  four have in common is stated here once; each kind's entry below holds what
  is its own.
  - **Authored:** none of the four has a spec, so the properties are the
    object's own top-level fields, decoded strictly at every depth. The
    object's `kind`, `apiVersion` and `metadata` are launcher's and are
    refused under any spelling.
  - **Presence rules read by hand.** Beyond the `+required` markers of the
    linked `k8s.io/api` module, these four kinds check presence rules read by
    hand from the API server's validation at Kubernetes v1.37.1
    (`pkg/apis/rbac/validation/validation.go` of `k8s.io/kubernetes`, which
    no module launcher links holds). No test derives them, and a later
    Kubernetes that changes one is not noticed by a dependency bump.
  - **Required from the markers** are the fields the API's source marks
    required and the Go type writes whether or not they were authored.
    `TestBuiltinMarkerKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers` derives each kind's list
    from the markers and fails on a dependency bump that changes it. The API
    marks no field of the four required that the type leaves out when
    unauthored; the same test fails if one appears.
    `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` holds the four in
    its table as well, from the same markers: to that, and to no default
    marked on a field the type writes unauthored. These checks are of
    presence: an authored empty value (`verbs: []`, `name: ""`) builds and is
    the API server's to refuse.
  - **A rule** (`rules[]` of a `role` or a `clusterrole`) must write its
    `verbs` (`rules[0].verbs: required …`, from the markers). By hand: it
    must name at least one of `apiGroups` and at least one of `resources`
    (`rules[0].apiGroups: required …`; `""` is the core group), so a rule
    that lost its resources and grants nothing is refused. A `clusterrole`
    rule may instead name `nonResourceURLs`, and then names no `apiGroups`,
    `resources` or `resourceNames`
    (`rules[0].nonResourceURLs: not allowed beside …`). These two hand-read
    checks count what was decoded, so an authored empty `apiGroups: []` or
    `resources: []` is refused too.
  - **A binding** (`rolebinding`, `clusterrolebinding`) must write `roleRef`
    with its `kind` and `name`, and each subject's `kind` and `name`
    (`roleRef: required …`, `subjects[0].name: required …`, from the
    markers). `subjects` may be left out: the API server's validation
    requires none, and the key is then not written.
  - **`roleRef.apiGroup` may be left out.** The object then carries
    `apiGroup: ""`, which the type always writes, and the API server fills
    the RBAC group before it validates. An authored group that is not the
    RBAC group is written as authored and is the API server's to refuse. A
    User or Group subject may leave its `apiGroup` out too: the key is then
    not written, and the API server fills the RBAC group the same way.
  - **The names are the author's literals.** `roleRef.name` and a subject's
    `name` and `namespace` are written as authored. Launcher points none of
    them at a component: a `roleRef.name` does not follow the `objectName`
    of a `role` or `clusterrole` component, and a ServiceAccount subject's
    name does not follow a `serviceaccount` component's, so write the name
    the object takes. Whether the role or the subject exists is not checked.
  - **Policy.** No field of the four is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks
    to, so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing.
  - **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  - **Beside the `rbac` trait.** A trait's object and a component's of one
    kind, name and namespace (or one cluster-scoped name) are refused: the
    trait resolves the name of each object it generates, and the transform
    reports a name collision that names both.
  - **Not covered.** Every rule on the form of a value is left to the API
    server: that a `roleRef` names the RBAC group and a kind the binding
    may grant, the kind and API group of a subject, the form of its name,
    and whether the `values` of a match expression of an aggregation
    selector fit its `operator`. Whether a verb, a resource or an API group
    exists, and the form of a non-resource URL, are checked by neither
    launcher nor the API server's validation: a rule that names none that
    exists builds and passes that validation. The API server refuses a change to the `roleRef` of an
    existing binding. Launcher does not compare a build with the cluster, so
    a changed one builds here and is refused at apply. Launcher does not
    compare what a role grants with what its author, or whoever applies the
    object, may grant.
  - **The object kind policy** (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922)
    is what restricts these kinds: it keeps any of the four, or the whole
    `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` group, out of a build, and a policy that
    does not allow cluster-scoped objects refuses the ClusterRole and the
    ClusterRoleBinding. It holds the `rbac` trait's objects too. What an
    allowed role grants stays unchecked here; the API server's escalate and
    bind checks hold it to the identity that applies it.
- **role** emits its Role in the build namespace; the handler declares its
  object as namespaced, so the object name is claimed in the object's
  namespace. **It is ungated: no capability and no environment-policy check
  restricts what a role grants.** Its one property is `rules`.
  `nonResourceURLs` are refused in a rule
  (`rules[0].nonResourceURLs: not allowed in a Role …`): a non-resource URL
  is not namespaced, and the API server refuses one in a Role. The API
  requires no rule, and the type always writes the list: a role that authors
  none carries `rules: null` and grants nothing, and an authored empty list
  is written as `[]`.
- **rolebinding** emits its RoleBinding in the build namespace; the handler
  declares its object as namespaced, so the object name is claimed in the
  object's namespace. **It is ungated: no capability and no
  environment-policy check restricts what a role grants**, nor to whom: a
  binding to any role the cluster holds, `cluster-admin` included, builds.
  Its properties are `subjects` and `roleRef`, which names a Role of the
  binding's namespace or a ClusterRole. A ServiceAccount subject may leave
  its `namespace` out: the API server's validation takes it, the key is not
  written, and the authorizer of that version reads the subject as one of
  the binding's own namespace.
- **clusterrole** emits its ClusterRole with no namespace; the handler
  declares its object as cluster-scoped, so the object name is claimed
  cluster-wide. **It is ungated: no capability and no environment-policy
  check restricts what a role grants.** Its properties are `rules` and
  `aggregationRule`. By hand: an authored `aggregationRule` must hold at
  least one entry of `clusterRoleSelectors`
  (`aggregationRule.clusterRoleSelectors: required …`); an empty selector
  (`{}`) is an entry. From the markers, a selector's match expression must
  write its `key` and `operator`. By hand again, an expression that writes
  both is refused for an operator that is none of the four and for `values`
  that do not go with the operator
  (`aggregationRule.clusterRoleSelectors[0].matchExpressions[0].values:
  required with the operator In (at least one value)`): the API server
  validates each selector as a label selector (see "A label selector's match
  expressions"). An aggregated ClusterRole builds: it is
  emitted with `rules: null` when `rules` is not authored and with
  `rules: []` when authored so, and the control plane fills the rules.
- **clusterrolebinding** emits its ClusterRoleBinding with no namespace; the
  handler declares its object as cluster-scoped, so the object name is
  claimed cluster-wide. **It is ungated: no capability and no
  environment-policy check restricts what a role grants**, nor to whom: a
  binding of `cluster-admin` to any subject builds. Its properties are
  `subjects` and `roleRef`, which names a ClusterRole. By hand: a
  ServiceAccount subject must write its `namespace`
  (`subjects[0].namespace: required …`), since the binding is in none.
- **horizontalpodautoscaler** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named
  projection of an `autoscaling/v2` HorizontalPodAutoscaler. It emits that
  one object in the build namespace, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it, holding exactly what was authored: the handler adds
  no label, no annotation and no default of its own. The handler declares its
  object as namespaced, so the object name is claimed in the object's namespace.
  - **Authored:** the five fields of `HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec`, decoded
    strictly at every depth: `scaleTargetRef`, `minReplicas`, `maxReplicas`,
    `metrics` and `behavior`. An unknown key is refused wherever it sits (a
    metric source, a scaling rule), a quantity written as a number is
    emitted in its canonical string form, and an authored `0` is kept
    (`stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0`). The type has no number or boolean
    that is omitted when zero, which
    `TestHorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec_NoOmittedZeros` holds it to.
  - **An empty `metrics` or `policies` list is refused.** The type omits
    `metrics` and a scaling rule's `policies` when empty, and the API server
    then applies its default: 80% average CPU utilization for `metrics`, and
    its default policies for `behavior.scaleUp` and `behavior.scaleDown`. So
    an authored `[]` cannot be carried (`metrics: [] cannot be carried by the
    Kubernetes API types (the field is omitted when empty, so the API server
    would apply its default …)`). See *Authored empty lists the API defaults*
    below.
  - **Required** are the two top-level fields the API server refuses an
    autoscaler without: `scaleTargetRef` (`scaleTargetRef: required …`) and
    `maxReplicas` (`maxReplicas: required …`; an authored `0` is refused
    the same way, since the type cannot tell it from an unset one). The
    config is exported, so `Generate` repeats both. Every other value rule
    is left to the API server: a negative `maxReplicas`, the `kind` and
    `name` inside `scaleTargetRef`, `minReplicas` against `maxReplicas`,
    which metric source goes with which `type`. The label selector of a
    metric (`metrics[].object.metric.selector`, and under `pods` and
    `external`) is not held as other kinds hold theirs: the API server
    validates nothing of it, and a kind does not refuse what the API admits.
  - **Policy.** `maxReplicas` is held to the environment policy's replica
    maximum (`MaxReplicas()`), as the `scaler` trait holds its own and as a
    HorizontalPodAutoscaler a chart renders, a `passthrough` component holds
    or a `manifests` source yields is held: `component "web": maxReplicas:
    replicas 4 exceeds enforced maximum 3`. Nothing else is held, and no
    default is filled: the policy's `scalerMinReplicas` and
    `scalerMaxReplicas` defaults belong to the `scaler` trait. A nil policy
    checks nothing.
  - **The target is the author's, and is not checked.** `scaleTargetRef`
    names an object by `kind`, `name` and `apiVersion`; launcher points it
    at no component and does not look for the object in the document. To
    scale a workload component, name its object: the component name, or its
    `objectName`. **The guards the `scaler` trait applies to its own
    workload do not see this kind:** a `deployment`, `webservice` or
    `worker` with a claim that is not ReadWriteMany refuses a `scaler` trait
    whose `maxReplicas` is above 1, and builds beside a
    `horizontalpodautoscaler` component that scales it further. That is the
    state of an autoscaler emitted through `passthrough`, `manifests` or
    template delivery.
  - **Beside the `scaler` trait.** The trait derives an autoscaler for the
    workload it is attached to, from a target CPU or memory utilization.
    This kind is the authored object, for what the trait does not express:
    other metric sources, scaling behavior, a target launcher does not own.
    The two name their objects apart (`<component>-hpa` for the trait), and
    two that are given one name in one namespace are refused as a name
    collision.
  - **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  - **Not covered.** Whether the target exists or can be scaled. The
    object's status is the controller's and is not written.
- **servicemonitor**, **podmonitor**, **prometheus-probe**, **prometheusrule**
  (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections of four objects of the
  Prometheus operator's `monitoring.coreos.com/v1` API: a ServiceMonitor, a
  PodMonitor, a Probe and a PrometheusRule. Each is built on `policyFreeKind`
  and emits that one object in the build namespace, named after the component
  unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default of its own. Each declares its object as namespaced, so the object name is
  claimed in the object's namespace. The Probe's type name carries a prefix
  because a probe, in this package, is a container's.

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds.** Launcher does
  not ask whether the cluster serves `monitoring.coreos.com/v1`: where the
  operator's CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is
  refused at apply. Whoever may author a component may author these. A policy
  can keep the kinds out of a build through the object kind policy
  (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (an endpoint, a relabeling rule, a rule of a group).
  - `servicemonitor` (`ServiceMonitorSpec`): `endpoints`, `selector`,
    `namespaceSelector`, `selectorMechanism`, `jobLabel`, `targetLabels`,
    `podTargetLabels`, `attachMetadata`, `bodySizeLimit`,
    `serviceDiscoveryRole`, and the scrape settings below.
  - `podmonitor` (`PodMonitorSpec`): `podMetricsEndpoints`, `selector`,
    `namespaceSelector`, `selectorMechanism`, `jobLabel`, `podTargetLabels`,
    `attachMetadata`, `bodySizeLimit`, and the scrape settings below.
  - `prometheus-probe` (`ProbeSpec`): `prober`, `targets`, `module`,
    `jobName`, `interval`, `scrapeTimeout`, `metricRelabelings`, `params`,
    the HTTP client settings the type embeds (`authorization`, `basicAuth`,
    `oauth2`, `bearerTokenSecret`, `followRedirects`, `enableHttp2`,
    `tlsConfig`), and the scrape settings below.
  - `prometheusrule` (`PrometheusRuleSpec`): `groups`, each with its `name`,
    `rules` and evaluation settings. A rule's `expr` is a string or a number
    and is emitted as the one authored.
  - The scrape settings the three scrape kinds share: `sampleLimit`,
    `targetLimit`, `labelLimit`, `labelNameLengthLimit`,
    `labelValueLengthLimit`, `keepDroppedTargets`, `scrapeProtocols`,
    `fallbackScrapeProtocol`, `scrapeClass`, `scrapeNativeHistograms`,
    `scrapeClassicHistograms`, `nativeHistogramBucketLimit`,
    `nativeHistogramMinBucketFactor` and `convertClassicHistogramsToNHCB`.
  - An authored `0` or `false` is kept where the API tells it from an unset
    field (`sampleLimit: 0`, `filterRunning: false`, a group's `limit: 0`), and
    left out where the type omits a zero that means the same
    (`honorLabels: false`). A quantity written as a number is emitted in its
    canonical string form (`nativeHistogramMinBucketFactor: 1.1` as `1100m`).
    The API's two defaults are strings (a prober's `path`, `/probe`, and a
    relabeling rule's `action`, `replace`): the type omits an empty string
    there, so an authored `""` would be defaulted, and it is refused
    (`prober.path: "" cannot be carried by the Prometheus operator API types
    (…)`). `TestMonitoringKinds_DefaultedZeros` holds each kind's list of
    such fields to the numbers, booleans and strings that are omitted when
    zero and defaulted to something else, from the default markers of the
    linked module's source.

  **Required** is a field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or
  not it was authored, so that the object would not show the omission. It is
  the rule every kind follows, not a wider one: sent as it was authored, the
  document is one the API server refuses, and only the Go type's zero value
  hides that. Each must be authored (`selector: required (…)`,
  `endpoints[1].oauth2.tokenUrl: required (…)`):
  - a `servicemonitor`'s `endpoints` and `selector`, and a `podmonitor`'s
    `selector`. No default selector is filled: unauthored, the type would
    write `selector: {}`, which selects every Service or pod of the selected
    namespaces. `selector: {}` and `endpoints: []` are authored values and
    build.
  - the `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `tokenUrl` of an `oauth2`, on an
    endpoint of either monitor and on a Probe;
  - a rule group's `name` and a rule's `expr` (unauthored, the type would
    write `expr: 0`);
  - the `key` and `operator` of a match expression, in a monitor's `selector`
    and in a Probe's `targets.ingress.selector`
    (`selector.matchExpressions[0].operator: required (…)`). The selector is
    a Kubernetes type, which carries no `+required` marker: the same test
    derives the two fields from that type's source by the schema generators'
    rule, that a field with no optional marker whose json tag keeps it when
    empty is required. Presence only: the operator's value and its `values`
    are left to the API server (see "A label selector's match expressions").

  **A required field the type leaves out when it is empty is refused too:**
  the `name` of a Probe parameter (`params[1].name: required (…)`), unauthored
  or empty. The object would show the omission and the API server refuse it.
  `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` derives these fields
  for every kind in its table, from the CRD the linked module ships or, where
  it ships none, from the markers of its source. It holds each to a refusal,
  shown on a document, or to a stated reason. The same test derives the
  fields the API defaults and the type writes unauthored, where the default
  would never apply, and holds each to one of three answers: refused, filled
  by the kind with the API's default, or harmless with the reason.

  The table holds the kind components that decode their properties into an
  upstream type, but for two groups. The `httproute` kind is not in it: the
  experimental-channel CRD requires the `protocol` of an `externalAuth`
  filter, of a rule and of a backend reference, the type leaves an empty one
  out, and the kind does not refuse it. The Flux kinds (`helmrelease`,
  `fluxcd-kustomization`, `helmrepository`, `ocirepository`, `gitrepository`,
  `bucket`, `helmchart`) are not in it either: no row is written for them.

  **A Probe needs `prober.url` here, because the object always carries a
  prober.** This is a limit of the Go type, not a rule of the API: the API
  does not require `prober`, but the type writes one whether or not it was
  authored, and the API server refuses a prober without a `url`. A Probe
  without a prober cannot be emitted. An empty `url` is refused as an
  unauthored one is.

  `TestMonitoringKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers` holds these lists to the fields
  the source marks required and the type writes unauthored, the linked
  module's and that of a match expression's type, so a dependency bump
  that adds, drops or moves one fails there. **Not refused:**
  - another required field of a Kubernetes type these specs embed: the `key`
    of a Secret or ConfigMap key reference. An omitted one is emitted empty;
  - an authored empty string in a required field (a group's `name: ""`),
    `prober.url` and a parameter's `name` excepted. It is a value, and the
    API server's to refuse;
  - every other value rule of the API (formats, enumerations, lengths, that a
    rule is a recording or an alerting one), and the operator's own checks of
    an object the API server has admitted: that a Probe has targets, that a
    scrape timeout is no longer than its interval, that an endpoint or a
    Probe authenticates one way. Whether a rule's expression is valid PromQL
    is not checked either.

  **What the type writes unauthored.** A `servicemonitor` or `podmonitor`
  carries `namespaceSelector: {}`, which selects the object's own namespace.
  A `podmonitor` without endpoints carries `podMetricsEndpoints: null`, which
  the API server drops as it drops every null of a field that is not
  nullable. A `prometheus-probe` carries `targets: {}`, and the operator
  rejects a Probe with no target. A `tlsConfig` carries `ca: {}` and
  `cert: {}` where they were not authored.

  **The selector, the prober and the targets are the author's.** Launcher
  points none at a component and looks for none in the document. To scrape a
  workload component's pods, select their `app` label
  (`matchLabels: {app: <component>}`, valued as "The `app` label" below
  describes); to scrape a `service` component's
  Service, select a label its object carries (the component label, see
  "Component label and ownership" in the OAM model). A Secret or ConfigMap an
  object refers to is read by the operator in the object's namespace.

  **Selected by a Prometheus through the object's labels.** A Prometheus
  picks these objects up through its label selectors
  (`serviceMonitorSelector`, `podMonitorSelector`, `probeSelector`,
  `ruleSelector`). The handler writes no label, so the object carries the
  component label, whose value is the component's, and what `labels` authors:
  for a Prometheus that selects on a fixed label (`release: <name>`, say),
  write that label there.

  **Policy.** No field of these specs is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to,
  so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and each builds the
  same under every policy and under none.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** A host these objects name is one Prometheus
    reaches, not an artifact source, and none is held to the policy's allowed
    registries: `prober.url`, a `proxyUrl` (of an endpoint, a prober or an
    `oauth2`), an `oauth2`'s `tokenUrl`, and the static targets of a Probe.
  - **No field holds a literal secret by design, and none is checked.** A
    credential is a reference to a key of a Secret: `authorization.credentials`,
    `basicAuth`, `bearerTokenSecret`, an `oauth2`'s `clientSecret`, a
    `tlsConfig`'s `keySecret`, the values of `proxyConnectHeader`. Free text
    that could hold one is written to the object as authored, under a policy
    that forbids explicit secrets too: `params`, an `oauth2`'s
    `endpointParams`, and a `proxyUrl` with credentials in it.
  - **File paths are not checked.** A `servicemonitor` endpoint may name a
    file in the Prometheus container (`bearerTokenFile`, and `caFile`,
    `certFile` and `keyFile` under `tlsConfig`).

  **Not covered.** Whether what is selected or referred to exists (a
  Service, a pod, an Ingress, a named port, a Secret key), and whether a
  Prometheus of the cluster selects the object. The object's status is the
  operator's and is not written.
- **issuer**, **clusterissuer**, **certificate** (go-kure/launcher#790) are
  the kind-named projections of three objects of cert-manager's
  `cert-manager.io/v1` API: an Issuer, a ClusterIssuer and a Certificate. Each
  is built on `policyHeldKind` (`policyFreeKind` with a policy check, see
  the **storageclass** entry) and emits that one object, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default. An `issuer` and a `certificate` are emitted in the build namespace
  and declare their object as namespaced. A `clusterissuer` is emitted with no
  namespace and declares its object as cluster-scoped, so its name is claimed
  in no namespace. An Issuer and a ClusterIssuer share one spec type
  (`IssuerSpec`), and what is said of an issuer below holds for both kinds.

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds.** Launcher does
  not ask whether the cluster serves `cert-manager.io/v1`: where cert-manager's
  CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is refused at
  apply. Whoever may author a component may author these, a ClusterIssuer
  included. A policy can keep the kinds out of a build through the object
  kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922). The
  `certificate` trait still requires its
  capability; the kind of the same name does not read it.

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (a solver, a DNS provider's settings, a keystore).
  - `issuer` and `clusterissuer` (`IssuerSpec`): the five issuer types, `acme`,
    `ca`, `vault`, `selfSigned` and `venafi`. An issuer type authored empty is
    in the object as written (`selfSigned: {}` is a complete self-signed
    issuer); one left out is not.
  - `certificate` (`CertificateSpec`): `secretName`, `issuerRef`, the subject
    (`commonName`, `subject`, `literalSubject`), the subject alternative names
    (`dnsNames`, `ipAddresses`, `uris`, `emailAddresses`, `otherNames`), the
    lifetime (`duration`, `renewBefore`, `renewBeforePercentage`, `renewal`),
    the key and its use (`privateKey`, `signatureAlgorithm`, `usages`,
    `encodeUsagesInRequest`, `isCA`, `nameConstraints`), and what is written
    to the Secret (`secretTemplate`, `keystores`, `additionalOutputFormats`),
    with `revisionHistoryLimit`.
  - **A duration is carried in Go's spelling.** `duration`, `renewBefore` and
    the other durations of these types are authored as a Go duration string
    and nothing else, and the object carries the same duration as Go writes
    it: `2160h` is emitted as `2160h0m0s`.
  - An authored `false` or `0` is kept where the API tells it from an unset
    field (`encodeUsagesInRequest: false`, a keystore's `create: false`, a
    solver pod's `runAsUser: 0`), and left out where the type omits a zero
    that means the same (`isCA: false`). `TestCertManagerKinds_NoDefaultedZeros`
    holds the types to having no number, boolean or string that is omitted
    when zero and that the CRD defaults to something else. A default cert-manager
    applies when it reads the object (a key size, a rotation policy) reads
    the same type, in which an authored `0` and none are one value.

  **Required** is a field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or
  not it was authored, so that the object would not show the omission: the
  rule every kind follows (see the Prometheus operator's kinds). Each
  must be authored (`secretName: required (…)`,
  `acme.solvers[1].dns01.webhook.groupName: required (…)`); an authored empty
  value is a value, and the API server's to refuse.
  - A `certificate`: `secretName`, and `issuerRef` with its `name`. No default
    issuer is filled. Of what is authored below them: an additional output
    format's `type`, and a keystore's `create`.
  - An issuer has no required top-level field. Of an issuer type that is
    authored: `acme.server` and `acme.privateKeySecretRef`; `ca.secretName`;
    `vault.server`, `vault.path` and `vault.auth`, and the role or path of
    the authentication method that is authored; `venafi.zone`, and the URL,
    credentials or token of the platform that is authored; a DNS01 provider's
    own required settings (an ACME-DNS `host`, an RFC 2136 `nameserver`, a
    webhook solver's `groupName` and `solverName`).
  - Of a reference to a Secret or a ServiceAccount that is authored, on either
    kind: its `name`. Unauthored, the type would write `name: ""`.
  - Of a renewal window of a `certificate` that is authored
    (`renewal.windows[]`): its `cron` and its `windowDuration`
    (`renewal.windows[0].cron: required (…)`). The type leaves either out when
    it is empty, so the object would show the omission and the API server
    refuse it; an empty `cron` is refused as an unauthored one is.
    `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` derives the two
    from the CRD and shows the refusals.
  - Of an ACME HTTP01 solver, on an issuer and a clusterissuer, three fields
    of the Kubernetes and Gateway API types it embeds: the `nodeSelectorTerms`
    of a required node affinity of the solver pod, under `http01.ingress` and
    under `http01.gatewayHTTPRoute`
    (`acme.solvers[0].http01.ingress.podTemplate.spec.affinity.nodeAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.nodeSelectorTerms:
    required (…)`), and the `name` of a parent reference
    (`acme.solvers[0].http01.gatewayHTTPRoute.parentRefs[0].name: required
    (…)`). Unauthored, the type writes the terms as `null`, which the API
    server drops before it validates, so the required field is then missing;
    and the name as `""`, which is below the CRD's minimum length of 1.
    `TestKindComponents_NullRequired` shows each refusal by running the CRD's
    schema validator on the object the type would encode. An authored empty
    name (`name: ""`) is not refused here: it is a value, and the API server's
    to refuse for that minimum length. An authored empty list of terms
    (`nodeSelectorTerms: []`) is not refused either: it is written as one,
    and the CRDs accept it.
  - Of a match expression that is authored in a label selector of an HTTP01
    solver's pod affinity (`acme.solvers[].http01.ingress.podTemplate.spec.affinity`,
    and under `gatewayHTTPRoute`), on an issuer and a clusterissuer: its `key`
    and `operator`. Presence only: the operator's value and its `values` are
    left to the API server (see "A label selector's match expressions").
  - A required field under a parent the author left out is not asked for: the
    list follows what was authored.

  `TestCertManagerKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the lists (96 paths for an
  issuer, 8 for a certificate) to the CRDs the linked module ships, which are
  the ones cert-manager's chart installs: every field of cert-manager's own
  types that a CRD requires and the type writes unauthored is listed, with the
  fields of an embedded type above (the three, and the `key` and `operator` of
  an expression at each of the 16 selectors), and nothing else is. A
  dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails there.
  `TestLabelSelectorKinds_CoverEverySelector` shows, at each of those
  selectors, what the API server answers for an expression without its `key`
  or its `operator`. **Not refused:**
  - every other required field of a Kubernetes or Gateway API type these
    specs embed (the `key` and `operator` of a node selector requirement, the
    `topologyKey` of an affinity term): the type writes it empty, and the
    CRDs accept it so;
  - every other value rule of the CRDs (enumerations, lengths, minima, and
    the one rule the CRDs write as an expression: that a `venafi` issuer
    names exactly one of `tpp`, `cloud` and `ngts`);
  - **the rules of cert-manager's validating webhook,** which refuses more
    than the CRDs do: an issuer that configures no issuer type, or more than
    one; a keystore with a `password` beside a `passwordSecretRef` that
    names a Secret, or with neither (the empty reference the type writes
    beside an authored `password` is not one); a certificate that names no
    subject and no alternative name; `subject` or `commonName` beside
    `literalSubject`.
    Launcher repeats none of them, so an `issuer` with no property builds,
    and is refused at apply where the webhook runs.

  **What the type writes unauthored.** An empty reference, `{name: ""}`,
  where the type holds one by value and the API does not require it: a
  keystore's `passwordSecretRef` (so a keystore that authors `password`
  carries both fields), `vault.auth.kubernetes.secretRef`, an RFC 2136
  solver's `tsigSecretSecretRef` and a Route 53 solver's
  `secretAccessKeySecretRef`. An HTTP01 solver's `podTemplate` carries
  `metadata: {}` and `spec: {}`, and its `ingressTemplate` `metadata: {}`.
  The CRDs accept each, and the same test holds every such field to its
  schema: none is refused empty.

  **Policy.**
  - **An issuer's ACME HTTP01 solver pod is held to the cpu and memory
    maxima.** cert-manager starts a pod to answer an HTTP01 challenge, and a
    solver's `podTemplate.spec.resources` sizes it. Its limits and requests
    are held to the environment policy's cpu and memory maxima, as a
    container's are, on both ways a solver answers (`http01.ingress`,
    `http01.gatewayHTTPRoute`) and on every solver: `component "web":
    acme.solvers[0].http01.ingress.podTemplate.spec.resources: cpu limit "4"
    exceeds enforced maximum "2"`. Nothing else is held and no default is
    filled: the policy's default requests and limits are a workload's. A
    request above its limit is not refused, since cert-manager lays the
    authored block over its controller's own defaults key by key, and the
    pair that reaches the pod is not the authored one. A solver pod template
    has no other field the `pod` kind's refusals speak to: it names no image
    (the solver's image is a flag of the cert-manager controller), no
    container security context, no volume and no host namespace. Its
    pod-level `securityContext`, `serviceAccountName`, `priorityClassName`
    and `imagePullSecrets` are the author's and are held to nothing, as are
    its `nodeSelector`, `affinity` and `tolerations`, as they are on a pod
    kind: the one field of a pod-level security context the policy holds
    there, `windowsOptions.hostProcess`, is not a field of this one.
  - **A certificate's keystore password in the object is refused under a
    policy that forbids explicit secrets.** `keystores.jks.password` and
    `keystores.pkcs12.password` hold the password itself, and the object is
    in the build's output: `component "web": keystores.jks.password: holds
    the keystore password in the object, and the environment policy forbids
    explicit secrets; name the key of a Secret created out of band in
    keystores.jks.passwordSecretRef instead`. The message quotes nothing of
    the value, and an empty password is refused as any other is. A policy
    that allows explicit secrets, one that does not answer the question and
    no policy build it. No other field of a Certificate holds a secret.
  - **No field of an issuer holds a literal secret by design, and none is
    checked.** A credential is a reference to a Secret: an ACME account key,
    a DNS provider's token, a Vault token or App Role secret, a platform's
    API credentials. Free JSON that could hold one is written to the object
    as authored, under a policy that forbids explicit secrets too: a webhook
    solver's `config`.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** A host these objects name is one cert-manager
    reaches, not an artifact source, and none is held to the policy's allowed
    registries: `acme.server`, `vault.server`, a `venafi` platform's `url`
    and token endpoint, an RFC 2136 `nameserver`, an ACME-DNS `host`, an
    Akamai `serviceConsumerDomain`, and the CRL distribution points, OCSP
    servers and issuing certificate URLs an issuer writes into what it
    signs.
  - A nil policy checks nothing.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. A
  solver's `podTemplate.metadata` is not these: it becomes the metadata of the
  pod cert-manager starts to answer an HTTP01 challenge. It is held as a pod's
  is, with or without a policy: on both ways a solver answers and on every
  solver, the component label's key holds the component's value there or the
  build is refused (`Issuer "web":
  spec.acme.solvers[0].http01.ingress.podTemplate.metadata.labels[…]: "db" is
  not the component label of component "web"`), and a key the consumer
  reserved is refused (`solver pod template label "…"
  (spec.acme.solvers[0].http01.ingress.podTemplate.metadata.labels) may not be
  set`); see "Component label and ownership" and "Reserved metadata keys" in
  the OAM model. Launcher writes nothing there. A solver's
  `ingressTemplate.metadata` and the `labels` of its HTTPRoutes reach an
  Ingress and HTTPRoutes, and are not read.

  **The issuer of a certificate is the author's.** `issuerRef` names an
  issuer by `name`, `kind` and `group`; launcher points it at no component
  and does not look for the issuer in the document. To have an `issuer` or
  `clusterissuer` component sign a `certificate` component, name its object:
  the component name, or its `objectName`. cert-manager reads an `issuerRef`
  without a `kind` as an Issuer of the Certificate's namespace. The Secret
  `secretName` names is cert-manager's to create, and the component emits
  none; a Secret an issuer refers to is read in the Issuer's namespace, and
  for a ClusterIssuer in the namespace cert-manager is configured with.

  **Beside the `certificate` trait.** The trait derives a Certificate for the
  workload it is attached to, from a few properties and the issuer the
  cluster's `certificate` capability names, and names it after its
  `secretName`. This kind is the authored object, for what the trait does not
  express: the whole spec, an issuer the author chooses, a Certificate that
  belongs to no workload. A component type and a trait type are two lists, so
  the one name is not ambiguous in a document. The two objects are one kind:
  a trait's and a component's given one name in one namespace are refused
  (`generated-object collision: Certificate.cert-manager.io
  "default/app-tls" is generated by both …`).

  **Not covered.** Whether what is referred to exists (an issuer, a
  Secret and its key, a ServiceAccount, an ingress class, a Gateway), and
  whether cert-manager can reach what an issuer names. The object's status is
  cert-manager's and is not written.
- **cilium-bgpadvertisement**, **cilium-bgpclusterconfig**,
  **cilium-bgpnodeconfigoverride**, **cilium-bgppeerconfig**
  (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections of four objects of
  Cilium's BGP control plane, in its `cilium.io/v2` API: a
  CiliumBGPAdvertisement, a CiliumBGPClusterConfig, a
  CiliumBGPNodeConfigOverride and a CiliumBGPPeerConfig. Each is built on
  `policyFreeKind` and emits that one object, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default. **All four are cluster-scoped**: the object carries no namespace,
  whatever namespace the application is built for, and its name is claimed
  cluster-wide. The type names carry the `cilium-` prefix: other products have
  a BGPAdvertisement and a BGP peer of their own. The fifth object of that
  API, the CiliumBGPNodeConfig, is generated by the Cilium operator and has no
  component.

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds.** Launcher does
  not ask whether the cluster runs Cilium or has its BGP control plane
  enabled: where the CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the
  object is refused at apply. Whoever may author a component may author
  these, and with them what the cluster's nodes announce to its routers. A
  policy can keep the kinds out of a build through the object kind policy
  (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (an advertisement, an instance, a peer, a family).
  - `cilium-bgpadvertisement` (`CiliumBGPAdvertisementSpec`):
    `advertisements`, each with its `advertisementType` (`PodCIDR`,
    `CiliumPodIPPool`, `Service` or `Interface`), `service` (`addresses`,
    `aggregationLengthIPv4`, `aggregationLengthIPv6`), `interface` (`name`),
    `selector` and `attributes` (`communities`, `localPreference`).
  - `cilium-bgpclusterconfig` (`CiliumBGPClusterConfigSpec`): `nodeSelector`
    and `bgpInstances`, each with its `name`, `localASN`, `localPort` and
    `peers`; a peer has a `name`, a `peerAddress` or an `autoDiscovery`, a
    `peerASN` and a `peerConfigRef`.
  - `cilium-bgpnodeconfigoverride` (`CiliumBGPNodeConfigOverrideSpec`):
    `bgpInstances`, each with its `name`, `routerID`, `localPort`, `localASN`
    and `peers`; a peer has a `name`, a `localAddress` and a `localPort`.
  - `cilium-bgppeerconfig` (`CiliumBGPPeerConfigSpec`): `transport`
    (`peerPort`, `sourceInterface`), `timers` (`connectRetryTimeSeconds`,
    `holdTimeSeconds`, `keepAliveTimeSeconds`), `authSecretRef`,
    `gracefulRestart` (`enabled`, `restartTimeSeconds`), `ebgpMultihop` and
    `families`, each with its `afi`, its `safi` and the `advertisements` it
    sends. A peer configuration that authors nothing builds, and carries
    nothing.
  - An authored `0` or `false` is kept: every number these specs hold is a
    pointer in the Go type (`peerASN: 0`, which accepts any ASN the peer opens
    with; `aggregationLengthIPv4: 0`), and `gracefulRestart.enabled` is always
    written. **No default is filled.** The API's defaults (a peer's `peerASN`,
    the three `timers`, `transport.peerPort`, `ebgpMultihop`,
    `gracefulRestart.restartTimeSeconds`) are the API server's to fill where
    the field was not authored; `TestCiliumBGPKinds_DefaultsSitOnPointers`
    holds each to a pointer field, from the CRDs of the linked module.

  **Required** follows the rule of the Prometheus operator's kinds: a
  field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or not it was
  authored. Each must be authored
  (`bgpInstances[0].peers[1].name: required (…)`):
  - a `cilium-bgpadvertisement`'s `advertisements` and an entry's
    `advertisementType`;
  - a `cilium-bgpclusterconfig`'s `bgpInstances`, an instance's `name`, a
    peer's `name`, an `autoDiscovery`'s `mode`, the `addressFamily` of its
    `defaultGateway`, and the `name` of a `peerConfigRef`;
  - a `cilium-bgpnodeconfigoverride`'s `bgpInstances`, an instance's `name`
    and a peer's `name`;
  - a `cilium-bgppeerconfig` family's `afi` and `safi`, and the `enabled` of a
    `gracefulRestart`, which has no default: unauthored, the type would write
    `enabled: false`;
  - the `key` and the `operator` of a match expression, in every selector of
    the four: `nodeSelector`, an advertisement's `selector`, a family's
    `advertisements`. The selector is Cilium's own type and its fields are in
    the CRD, so these are derived with the rest; on the Prometheus operator's
    kinds, whose selector is the Kubernetes one, they are not.

  `TestCiliumBGPKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds these lists to the fields the
  linked module's `v2` CRD requires and the type writes unauthored, so a
  dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails there.

  **Two required fields the type leaves out when they are empty are refused
  too,** on an advertisement: the `name` of an `interface`
  (`advertisements[0].interface.name: required (…)`) and the `addresses` of a
  `service`, an authored `addresses: []` included
  (`advertisements[0].service.addresses: required (…)`). The object would show
  the omission (`service: {}`) and the API server refuse it. The same test
  holds the two to the CRD, and
  `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` shows the refusals.

  **The CRDs' expression rules.** A rule is checked where it is one
  comparison of fields, as authored or as the CRD defaults them, and the
  refusal can name what it compared; every rule the
  four CRDs declare is classified in `TestCiliumBGPKinds_ExpressionRules`,
  which fails on one that is added or reworded. The same test holds each
  checked rule to the API server's own expression validator, run over the
  linked CRD after the defaults the API server fills: it refuses the
  properties that break the rule, by that rule alone, and accepts the ones
  next to them, and the kind answers the same on both. **Checked:**
  - the five rules on an advertisement, each the entry's `advertisementType`
    against the presence of one sibling: `service` is required with `Service`
    and refused with another type, `interface` is required with `Interface`
    and refused with another type, and `selector` is refused with `PodCIDR`
    (`advertisements[1].service: not allowed with advertisementType
    "CiliumPodIPPool", only with "Service"`). An authored `{}` is a present
    field and an authored `null` an absent one, as the API server reads them;
  - a peer configuration's `timers.keepAliveTimeSeconds` no larger than its
    `timers.holdTimeSeconds` (`timers.keepAliveTimeSeconds: 90 is larger than
    timers.holdTimeSeconds (30)`). The API server evaluates the rule after it
    has filled the defaults, so **with one of the two authored it compares
    that one with the default of the other, and so does the kind**: a
    keepalive of 30 and a hold time of 90, the linked CRD's, which the kind
    states and the test holds to that CRD. `keepAliveTimeSeconds: 100` alone
    is refused (`timers.keepAliveTimeSeconds: 100 is larger than the hold time
    the API fills where timers.holdTimeSeconds is not set (90)`), and so is
    `holdTimeSeconds: 20` alone (`timers.holdTimeSeconds: 20 is smaller than
    the keepalive time the API fills where timers.keepAliveTimeSeconds is not
    set (30)`). A cluster whose installed CRD fills other defaults than the
    linked one is not known here.

  **Not checked**, and the API server's to refuse:
  - an authored empty value in a required field (`bgpInstances: []`, an
    instance's `name: ""`). It is a value. The two fields above are the
    exception: the type leaves an empty one out;
  - every other value rule of the API: the enumerations
    (`advertisementType`, `afi`, `safi`, a service address type, a well-known
    community), the ranges of an ASN, a port, a timer, an aggregation length
    and `ebgpMultihop`, the forms of an address, a router ID and a community,
    the number of instances (one to sixteen in a cluster configuration, at
    least one in an override), an instance name unique in its list and a peer
    name unique in its instance;
  - what Cilium itself decides of an object the API server has admitted.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  **A peer configuration selects advertisements by label.** A family's
  `advertisements` is a label query over CiliumBGPAdvertisement objects: write
  the labels it names under the `labels` of the `cilium-bgpadvertisement`.
  The object also carries the component label, whose value is the component's
  (see "Component label and ownership" in the OAM model). `nodeSelector` and
  an advertisement's `selector` query nodes, pools and Services, whose labels
  are their owners'.

  **An override takes effect by its name.** A CiliumBGPNodeConfigOverride
  overrides the CiliumBGPNodeConfig of the same name, the per-node object the
  Cilium operator generates; Cilium's API says the two names must match
  exactly. Name the component so, or set `objectName`. Launcher does not know
  the cluster's objects and checks neither.

  **Policy.** No field of these specs is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to,
  so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and each builds the
  same under every policy and under none.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** An address these objects name is a BGP peer's
    or the node's own, not an artifact source, and none is held to the
    policy's allowed registries: a peer's `peerAddress` in a
    `cilium-bgpclusterconfig`, and a peer's `localAddress` and an instance's
    `routerID` in a `cilium-bgpnodeconfigoverride`.
  - **No field holds a literal secret, and none is checked.**
    `authSecretRef` is the name of a Secret Cilium fetches the session's TCP
    authentication password from. The field holds a name and no namespace:
    where Cilium looks the Secret up is its own configuration. Launcher does
    not emit that Secret for it and does not check that one exists.

  **Not covered.** The served `v2alpha1` version of these objects: the kinds
  emit `v2`. Whether what is selected or referred to exists (a node, a pool,
  a Service, an advertisement, a peer configuration, a Secret), and whether
  the cluster's Cilium runs its BGP control plane. A
  `cilium-bgpclusterconfig`'s and a `cilium-bgppeerconfig`'s status is the
  operator's and is not written.
- **cilium-cidrgroup**, **cilium-loadbalancerippool**,
  **cilium-egressgatewaypolicy**, **cilium-localredirectpolicy**,
  **cilium-nodeconfig** (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections
  of five more objects of Cilium's `cilium.io/v2` API: a CiliumCIDRGroup, a
  CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool, a CiliumEgressGatewayPolicy, a
  CiliumLocalRedirectPolicy and a CiliumNodeConfig. Each is built on
  `policyFreeKind` and emits that one object, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default of its own. **The first three are cluster-scoped**: the object carries no
  namespace, whatever namespace the application is built for, and its name is
  claimed cluster-wide. **The redirect policy and the node configuration are
  namespaced** and are written in the build namespace.

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds**, as for the
  BGP kinds: where the CRDs are not installed, or the feature the object
  configures is not enabled in the cluster's Cilium (egress gateway, local
  redirect policies, load balancer address management), the component builds.
  Whoever may author a component may author these, and with them the address
  a workload's traffic leaves the cluster with, where a node sends traffic
  meant for an address or a Service, and the configuration of the Cilium
  agent on a node. A policy can keep the kinds out of a build through the
  object kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (a block, a selector, a gateway, a matcher, a port).
  - `cilium-cidrgroup` (`CiliumCIDRGroupSpec`): `externalCIDRs`.
  - `cilium-loadbalancerippool` (`CiliumLoadBalancerIPPoolSpec`):
    `serviceSelector`, `allowFirstLastIPs` (`Yes` or `No`), `blocks`, each a
    `cidr` or a `start` with an optional `stop`, and `disabled`.
  - `cilium-egressgatewaypolicy` (`CiliumEgressGatewayPolicySpec`):
    `selectors`, each with a `namespaceSelector`, a `podSelector` and a
    `nodeSelector`; `destinationCIDRs`; `excludedCIDRs`; `egressGateway` and
    `egressGateways`, a gateway being a `nodeSelector`, an `interface` and an
    `egressIP`.
  - `cilium-localredirectpolicy` (`CiliumLocalRedirectPolicySpec`):
    `redirectFrontend`, an `addressMatcher` (`ip`, `toPorts`) or a
    `serviceMatcher` (`serviceName`, `namespace`, `toPorts`);
    `redirectBackend` (`localEndpointSelector`, `toPorts`);
    `skipRedirectFromBackend`; `description`. A port is a `port`, a
    `protocol` and a `name`.
  - `cilium-nodeconfig` (`CiliumNodeConfigSpec`): `defaults`, a map of
    configuration keys to string values, and `nodeSelector`.
  - **No default is filled, and an authored value that is the API's default
    is not written where the Go type cannot hold it.** Three fields of these
    specs are no pointers and are omitted when empty: a pool's `disabled`, a
    redirect policy's `skipRedirectFromBackend` and an egress gateway
    policy's `egressGateways`. An authored `disabled: false`,
    `skipRedirectFromBackend: false` or `egressGateways: []` is left out of
    the object, and the API server fills the same value back: each of the
    three has that empty value as its default in the CRD.
    `TestCiliumPlainKinds_NoDefaultIsLost` holds the defaults of the linked
    CRDs to that: one that is not the field's empty value, on a field that is
    no pointer, fails there.

  **Required** follows the rule of the BGP kinds: a field the API requires
  that the Go type writes whether or not it was authored. Each must be
  authored (`egressGateways[1].nodeSelector: required (…)`):
  - a `cilium-cidrgroup`'s `externalCIDRs`;
  - a `cilium-egressgatewaypolicy`'s `selectors`, `destinationCIDRs` and
    `egressGateway`, and the `nodeSelector` of `egressGateway` and of every
    entry of `egressGateways`;
  - a `cilium-localredirectpolicy`'s `redirectFrontend` and
    `redirectBackend`; an `addressMatcher`'s `ip` and `toPorts`; a
    `serviceMatcher`'s `serviceName` and `namespace`; the backend's
    `localEndpointSelector` and `toPorts`; the `port` and the `protocol` of
    every port, in each of the three lists;
  - a `cilium-nodeconfig`'s `defaults` and `nodeSelector`;
  - the `key` and the `operator` of a match expression, in every selector of
    the five. A `cilium-loadbalancerippool` requires nothing else.

  An authored empty value satisfies the rule: `externalCIDRs: []` is a group
  that selects no peer, `nodeSelector: {}` every node and `defaults: {}` no
  key. `TestCiliumPlainKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds these lists to the
  fields the linked module's `v2` CRD requires and the type writes
  unauthored, so a dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails there.

  **A redirect frontend takes exactly one matcher.** The CRD's schema of
  `redirectFrontend` is a choice between `addressMatcher` and
  `serviceMatcher`, and the API server refuses neither and both. It is one
  comparison of two authored fields, so the kind refuses it too
  (`redirectFrontend: one of addressMatcher and serviceMatcher is required`;
  `redirectFrontend: addressMatcher and serviceMatcher are both set; the API
  takes exactly one`). `TestCiliumPlainKinds_RedirectFrontendTakesOneMatcher`
  holds the check to the CRD, and fails where another schema of the five
  gains such a choice.

  **The CRDs' expression rules.** The five CRDs declare five, and none is
  checked; `TestCiliumPlainKinds_ExpressionRules` lists each with why, and
  fails on one that is added or reworded.

  **Not checked**, and the API server's to refuse:
  - a gateway's `egressIP` being an IP address, the CRD's rule on
    `egressGateway.egressIP` and on an `egressGateways` entry's: the form of
    one field's value, not a comparison of authored fields;
  - the three rules that refuse a change of a redirect policy's
    `redirectFrontend`, `redirectBackend` and `skipRedirectFromBackend` once
    the object exists. Each compares the object with the stored one, and a
    build has none: such a change builds here and is refused at apply, until
    the object is deleted and created again;
  - a `cilium-nodeconfig`'s `defaults`: no key and no value is read. A key
    Cilium does not know builds;
  - an authored empty value in a required field (`selectors: []`, a
    `serviceName: ""`). It is a value;
  - every other value rule of the API: the enumerations (`allowFirstLastIPs`,
    a port's `protocol`), the forms of a CIDR, an address, a port and a port
    name, and the number of `egressGateways` (at most 64);
  - what Cilium itself decides of an object the API server has admitted: a
    `serviceMatcher` whose `namespace` is not the policy's own, which Cilium's
    API says must match, and two pools whose blocks overlap, which the Cilium
    operator reports in the pool's status.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  **A CIDR group is referred to by its name, or selected by its labels.** A
  Cilium network policy's `cidrGroupRef` names the group: name the component
  so, or set `objectName`. Its `cidrGroupSelector` is a label query over
  groups: write the labels it names under the `labels` of the
  `cilium-cidrgroup`. The object also carries the component label, whose
  value is the component's (see "Component label and ownership" in the OAM
  model). Every other selector in the five specs queries objects launcher
  does not write the labels of here (Services, nodes, namespaces, pods) and
  is the author's.

  **Policy.** No field of these specs is one an `oam.Policy` method speaks to,
  so `ApplyPolicy` enforces nothing and fills nothing, and each builds the
  same under every policy and under none.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** No field names a host. An address or a CIDR
    these objects hold is a network's, not an artifact source, and none is
    held to the policy's allowed registries: a group's `externalCIDRs`, a
    pool's `blocks`, an egress policy's `destinationCIDRs`, `excludedCIDRs`
    and `egressIP`, and a redirect frontend's `ip`.
  - **No field holds a literal secret or refers to a Secret, and none is
    checked.** A `cilium-nodeconfig`'s `defaults` is free text: a value
    written there is written into the object as authored.

  **Not covered.** The served `v2alpha1` version of the CIDR group, of the
  pool and of the node configuration: the kinds emit `v2`. Whether what is selected or referred to
  exists (a Service, a node, a namespace, a pod, an interface). A pool's and
  a redirect policy's status is the operator's and is not written.
- **cilium-clusterwidenetworkpolicy** (go-kure/launcher#790) is the kind-named
  projection of a cluster-scoped cilium.io/v2 CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy.
  The object holds what a CiliumNetworkPolicy holds: one rule under `spec`, a
  list of rules under `specs`, or both, each a Cilium `api.Rule`. The
  component's properties are those two fields, decoded as the
  `cilium-networkpolicy` kind decodes them: strictly, under the null contract,
  with an unknown key inside a selector, an `icmps` field or a rule label
  refused by its path (see that entry). `TestCoreKindSchemas_CoverSpec` holds
  the two keys to the linked `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` type. It emits
  one object, named after the component unless `objectName` names it, with no
  namespace, declared cluster-scoped, holding the authored rules and, as on
  every kind component, the labels and annotations written under `labels` and
  `annotations`. It differs from the namespaced kind in two things: its rules reach
  every namespace of the cluster, and a rule selects endpoints or nodes, by
  `endpointSelector` or by `nodeSelector`.

  **Refused at build: what the CRD's schema refuses of the two fields, and
  nothing wider.** Three rules of that schema, each one comparison of authored
  fields:
  - no rule at all, neither `spec` nor an entry in `specs` (the object's
    expression rule `has(self.spec) || has(self.specs)`). An empty `specs` is
    not emitted, so it holds none; beside a `spec` it is accepted.
    `TestCiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy_ObjectRule` holds the refusal to the
    API server's own expression validator, which accepts an authored
    `specs: []` and would refuse the object written without it;
  - a rule that authors both `endpointSelector` and `nodeSelector`, or
    neither: the schema takes exactly one. None is filled in.
    `endpointSelector: {}` selects every endpoint of the cluster and
    `nodeSelector: {}` every node, and each is carried as written; a null one
    is an absent one;
  - a rule with no entry in any of `ingress`, `ingressDeny`, `egress` and
    `egressDeny`. A deny list counts as much as an allow list; a null or empty
    list is not emitted and holds no entry.

  A null entry of `specs` is refused by its path.

  **Required.** Inside a rule the CRD requires 59 fields that the Cilium type
  writes whether or not they were authored, so that the object would not show
  the omission. Each is refused where its parent is authored, by its path
  (`spec.ingress[0].toPorts[0].terminatingTLS.secret: required (…)`):
  - the `key` and `operator` of a match expression, in every selector of a
    rule (`endpointSelector`, `nodeSelector`, `fromEndpoints`, `toEndpoints`,
    `fromNodes`, `toNodes`, a CIDR entry's `cidrGroupSelector`, a
    `k8sServiceSelector`'s `selector`), under the deny lists too;
  - a `k8sServiceSelector`'s `selector`, the `key` of a rule label and the
    `type` of an `icmps` field;
  - under an allow list only: an `authentication`'s `mode`; a port's
    `listener` `name`, its `envoyConfig` and that configuration's `name`; the
    `secret` of a port's `terminatingTLS` and `originatingTLS` and that
    Secret's `name`; an HTTP header match's `name`, and the `name` of its
    `secret` where one is authored.

  Two more are optional to the API and required here: a listener's `priority`
  and the `kind` of its `envoyConfig`. The type writes an unauthored one as
  `0` and as the empty string, and the API refuses both (a priority is 1 to
  100, a kind is `CiliumEnvoyConfig` or `CiliumClusterwideEnvoyConfig`), so a
  listener that leaves one out cannot be emitted.
  `TestCiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the whole list
  to the CRD of the linked module and to the rule type, under `spec` and
  under `specs`, so a dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails
  there. An `icmps` field without its `type` and a rule label without its
  `key` are refused earlier, by Cilium's own decoding, with the decode error
  (for the `type`, one that names a panic and not the field's position).

  **Not checked.** These are the API server's to refuse, or Cilium's:
  - the choices the schema makes deeper in a rule: a CIDR entry (`toCIDRSet`,
    `fromCIDRSet`) holds exactly one of `cidr`, `cidrGroupRef` and
    `cidrGroupSelector`; a DNS entry (`toFQDNs`, a port's `rules.dns`) exactly
    one of `matchName` and `matchPattern`; a port's `rules` exactly one of
    `http` and `dns`. `TestCiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy_SchemaChoices` lists
    every choice and expression rule of the linked CRD as checked or left,
    and fails on one that is neither;
  - every value rule: enumerations, patterns, ranges, lengths and formats (an
    `authentication` mode, a port, a CIDR, an ICMP family), and an authored
    empty value in a required field;
  - what Cilium's own reader refuses of an object the API server has admitted
    (which peers may be combined, an entity's name, a port's range). The
    `cilium-networkpolicy` kind leaves these too;
  - whether what a rule refers to exists: a CIDR group, a Secret, an Envoy
    configuration, a Service.

  **What the object carries that was not written.** An `icmps` field's
  `family` is left out when it is not authored, and the API fills `IPv4`, the
  one default the CRD declares in a rule. An authored `family: ""` is left
  out as well and reads the same, to Cilium too. A rule label in its object
  form without a `source` carries `source: ""`, which the type writes and the
  API admits.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` is a no-op and no capability is required, as for
  the `cilium-networkpolicy` kind: the environment policy holds no rule for
  the object, and its capability lists gate trait types.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** A rule names hosts and networks: the names and
    patterns of `toFQDNs` and of a port's DNS rules, an HTTP rule's `host`, a
    port's `serverNames`, and every CIDR. None is an artifact source, and
    none is held to the policy's allowed registries.
  - **No literal secret is checked.** An HTTP header match's `value` is
    written into the object as authored. A header match's `secret` and a TLS
    context's `secret` refer to a Secret by name and namespace; the reference
    is written as authored, and the Secret is not looked for in the document.

  **Not covered.** The object's metadata beyond its name, its labels and its
  annotations (`objectName`, `labels`, `annotations`), and its `status`, which
  the Cilium agent writes.
- **gatewayclass**, **gateway**, **listenerset**, **referencegrant**,
  **backendtlspolicy** (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named projections
  of the infrastructure objects of the Gateway API's
  `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`: a GatewayClass, a Gateway, a ListenerSet, a
  ReferenceGrant and a BackendTLSPolicy. Each is built on `policyFreeKind`
  (see the **storageclass** entry) and emits that one object, named after the component unless
  `objectName` names it; the handler adds no label, no annotation and no
  default. A `gatewayclass` is emitted with no namespace and declares its
  object as cluster-scoped, so its name is claimed in no namespace. The other
  four are emitted in the build namespace and declare their object as
  namespaced. The routes of the same API are their own kinds (`httproute`,
  `grpcroute`, `tcproute`, `udproute`, `tlsroute`).

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds.** Launcher does
  not ask whether the cluster serves `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1`: where the
  Gateway API's CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is
  refused at apply. Whoever may author a component may author these: a
  GatewayClass, which is cluster-scoped, and a ReferenceGrant, which lets
  objects of another namespace refer to objects of the build namespace,
  included. A policy can keep the kinds out of a build through the object
  kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922). The
  `httproute` trait may take the Gateway
  it attaches to from a capability (`gatewayName`, `gatewayNamespace`); the
  `gateway` kind does not read it, and a `gateway` component is not what that
  capability names unless the platform says so.

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (a listener, a certificate reference, a validation).
  - `gatewayclass` (`GatewayClassSpec`): `controllerName`, `parametersRef` and
    `description`.
  - `gateway` (`GatewaySpec`): `gatewayClassName`, `listeners`, `addresses`,
    `infrastructure`, `allowedListeners`, `tls` and `defaultScope`.
    **`defaultScope` is an experimental-channel field:** the Go type holds it
    and the standard channel's Gateway CRD does not, so a cluster on that
    channel does not keep it. It is the only such field of these five specs
    at v1.6.3, and `TestGatewayKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds that.
  - `listenerset` (`ListenerSetSpec`): `parentRef` and `listeners`, whose
    entries take the fields of a Gateway's listener.
  - `referencegrant` (`ReferenceGrantSpec`): `from` and `to`.
  - `backendtlspolicy` (`BackendTLSPolicySpec`): `targetRefs`, `validation`
    and `options`.
  - **No default is filled.** The defaults are the CRDs', and the API server
    applies them to what the object leaves out: a listener's `allowedRoutes`
    (routes of the Gateway's own namespace), a listener's `tls.mode`
    (`Terminate`), an address's `type` (`IPAddress`), the `group` and `kind`
    of a certificate reference (a core Secret) and of a parent reference (a
    Gateway), the `group` of an allowed route kind (the Gateway API's),
    `allowedListeners.namespaces.from` (`None`), a client certificate
    validation's `mode` (`AllowValidOnly`).
  - One number of these types is omitted when zero, a ListenerSet listener's
    `port`, and the CRD gives it no default: an authored `port: 0` is left out
    as an unset one is, the API accepts neither, and the kind refuses both
    (below). Of the strings the types omit when empty, the CRDs default one:
    the `mode` of a Gateway's frontend TLS validation (`AllowValidOnly`), so
    an authored `mode: ""` would be left out and defaulted, and it is refused
    (`tls.frontend.default.validation.mode: "" cannot be carried by the
    Gateway API types (…)`).
    `TestGatewayKinds_DefaultedZeros` holds each kind's list of such fields to
    the numbers, booleans and strings that are omitted when zero and that a
    CRD of either channel defaults to something else.

  **Required** is a field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or
  not it was authored, so that the object would not show the omission: the
  rule every kind follows (see the Prometheus operator's kinds). Each
  must be authored (`gatewayClassName: required (…)`,
  `listeners[1].port: required (…)`); an authored empty value is a value, and
  the API server's to refuse.
  - A `gatewayclass`: `controllerName`.
  - A `gateway`: `gatewayClassName` and `listeners`, and of each listener its
    `name`, `port` and `protocol`. Of a Gateway-wide `tls.frontend` that is
    authored: its `default` (`default: {}` asks for no client certificate),
    and of a `perPort` entry its `port` and `tls`; of a `validation` that is
    authored, its `caCertificateRefs`.
  - A `listenerset`: `parentRef` with its `name`.
  - A `referencegrant`: `from` and `to`; of a source its `group`, `kind` and
    `namespace`, of a target its `group` and `kind`. The core group is
    authored as `group: ""`.
  - A `backendtlspolicy`: `validation` with its `hostname`; of a subject
    alternative name that is authored, its `type`.
  - Of a reference that is authored, on every kind, what the type would write
    empty: the `name` of a certificate reference (a listener's
    `tls.certificateRefs`, the Gateway's `tls.backend.clientCertificateRef`);
    the `group`, `kind` and `name` of a parameters reference
    (`parametersRef`, `infrastructure.parametersRef`), of a CA certificate
    reference (`caCertificateRefs`) and of a policy target (`targetRefs`);
    the `kind` of an allowed route kind (`allowedRoutes.kinds`).
  - Of a match expression that is authored in a namespace `selector`, on a
    `gateway` and a `listenerset` (a listener's
    `allowedRoutes.namespaces.selector`, a Gateway's
    `allowedListeners.namespaces.selector`): its `key` and `operator`, which
    the CRDs of both channels require. Presence only: the operator's value
    and its `values` are left to the API server (see "A label selector's
    match expressions"). The selector is the one Kubernetes type these specs
    embed; the test below derives these entries with the others, and
    `TestLabelSelectorKinds_CoverEverySelector` shows what the API server
    answers for them.
  - A required field under a parent the author left out is not asked for: the
    list follows what was authored.

  **A required field the type omits is refused by the kind itself,** since no
  required list can name it: the type leaves it out where it is not authored
  and where it is authored empty alike, and the API server refuses the object
  either way. There are five at v1.6.3:
  - a `listenerset` with no `listeners` and a `backendtlspolicy` with no
    `targetRefs`, absent or empty (`listeners: required (…)`), as a
    `servicecidr` with no `cidrs` is;
  - a ListenerSet listener without its `name`, its `port` or its `protocol`,
    absent or empty, a `port: 0` included
    (`listeners[1].port: required (…)`). A Gateway's listener must author the
    same three, by the list above: the two listener types carry different
    json tags, and the answer is the same on both kinds.

  `TestGatewayKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` derives that set from the CRDs as it
  derives the lists, at every depth of the five specs, and holds each member to
  one of two answers: the kind's refusal, which it runs, or a stated reason
  the decoded value cannot show the omission. None has the second answer.
  `TestGatewayKinds_RefusedOmissions` holds each refused field to being
  required in both channels.

  `TestGatewayKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the lists (4 paths for a
  gatewayclass, 26 for a gateway, 6 for a listenerset, 7 for a referencegrant,
  9 for a backendtlspolicy) to the CRDs the linked module ships. The module
  ships two sets, one per channel of the API. The experimental one holds every
  field the Go types do and is the one each path is read in; the standard one
  must require the same wherever it holds the property. Every field of the
  Gateway API's own types that the CRDs require and the type writes
  unauthored is listed, with the `key` and `operator` of a namespace
  selector's expressions, and nothing else is; no field is written empty
  unauthored beside those. A dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one
  fails there. **Not refused:**
  - a list the API wants at least one item of that is authored empty, where
    the type writes it (`listeners: []` on a `gateway`, `from: []`): an
    authored empty value is a value;
  - every other value rule of the CRDs: enumerations, lengths, patterns,
    minima and item limits, and the rules the CRDs write as expressions (a
    listener's `tls` and `hostname` against its `protocol`, the uniqueness of
    a listener's name and of its port, protocol and hostname, of an address
    and of a `perPort` port, one of `caCertificateRefs` and
    `wellKnownCACertificates`, a subject alternative name's field against
    its `type`, a target's `sectionName` among several targets, a
    GatewayClass's `controllerName` not changing);
  - what a Gateway API controller refuses when it reads the object, which
    shows in the object's status, not at creation.

  **Policy.** No dimension of the environment policy reaches these objects:
  they run no pod, hold no image, request no storage and have no replica
  count. A nil policy and a strict one build the same object.
  - **The pods of a Gateway are not sized here.** A controller may start a
    proxy for a Gateway; the Gateway object holds no pod template and no
    resources, so the policy's maxima and defaults have nothing to hold.
    `infrastructure.labels` and `infrastructure.annotations` are written as
    authored, and what a controller reads into them is its own; they are held
    to the component label and the reserved keys with or without a policy
    (see "Labels and annotations" below).
  - **No field holds a literal secret, and none is checked.** A certificate is
    a reference: to a Secret on a listener and for the Gateway's client
    certificate, to a ConfigMap or another object for CA certificates. The
    free maps a controller defines, a listener's `tls.options` and a
    BackendTLSPolicy's `options`, are written to the object as authored,
    under a policy that forbids explicit secrets too.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** A host these objects name is one a Gateway
    serves or a backend is checked against, not an artifact source, and none
    is held to the policy's allowed registries: a listener's `hostname`, an
    address's `value`, a BackendTLSPolicy's `validation.hostname` and the
    `hostname` and `uri` of its subject alternative names.

  **References are the author's.** A Gateway names its class
  (`gatewayClassName`), a ListenerSet its Gateway (`parentRef`), a
  BackendTLSPolicy its backends (`targetRefs`), and each of them Secrets or
  ConfigMaps; launcher points none at a component and does not look for the
  target in the document. To refer to another component's object, name it:
  the component name, or its `objectName`. A ListenerSet attaches only where
  its Gateway's `allowedListeners` lets its namespace, and a reference across
  namespaces works only where a ReferenceGrant of the target's namespace
  allows it; launcher checks neither. A `referencegrant` allows references
  into the namespace it is emitted in, so it belongs to the application of
  the objects referred to.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. A
  Gateway's `infrastructure.labels` and `infrastructure.annotations` are not
  these: they are what the controller puts on the resources it creates for the
  Gateway, which may be pods. They are held as a pod's are: the component
  label's key holds the component's value there or the build is refused, and a
  key the consumer reserved is refused (`spec.infrastructure label "…" may not
  be set`); see "Component label and ownership" and "Reserved metadata keys"
  in the OAM model. Launcher writes nothing there.

  **Not covered.** Whether what is referred to exists (a class, a Gateway,
  a Secret, a ConfigMap, a Service and its port), and whether a controller of
  the cluster implements the class. The object's status is the controller's
  and is not written.
- **tcproute**, **udproute**, **tlsroute** (go-kure/launcher#790) are the
  kind-named projections of the routes of the Gateway API's
  `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1` that carry no HTTP: a TCPRoute, a UDPRoute
  and a TLSRoute. Each is built on `policyFreeKind` (above), as the kinds of
  the API's infrastructure objects are, and emits that one object in the build
  namespace, named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the
  handler adds no label, no annotation and no default. The object is written at
  `v1`, the version the CRDs of both channels store; the older versions
  (`v1alpha2`, and `v1alpha3` of a TLSRoute) are served by the experimental
  channel's CRDs only, as deprecated.

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds,** on the terms of
  the infrastructure kinds above: launcher does not ask whether the cluster
  serves the API, and where the CRD is not installed the component builds and
  the object is refused at apply. Whoever may author a component may author a
  route, one that attaches to a Gateway of another namespace or sends traffic
  to a backend of another namespace included (below).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  those of the `CommonRouteSpec` it inlines included, decoded strictly at
  every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits (a parent, a rule, a
  backend).
  - `tcproute` (`TCPRouteSpec`) and `udproute` (`UDPRouteSpec`):
    `parentRefs`, `useDefaultGateways` and `rules`. The API accepts exactly
    one rule.
  - `tlsroute` (`TLSRouteSpec`): the same three and `hostnames`, the server
    names (SNI) of the TLS handshakes the route takes. A name may start with
    the wildcard label `*.`. The route holds no certificate and no key: by the
    Gateway API's documentation the listener it attaches to passes the
    connection through or terminates it.
  - **`useDefaultGateways` is an experimental-channel field:** the Go types
    hold it and the standard channel's CRDs do not, so a cluster on that
    channel does not keep it. It is the only such field of these specs at
    v1.6.3, and `TestGatewayKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds that.
  - **No default is filled.** The defaults are the CRDs', and the API server
    applies them to what the object leaves out: the `group` and `kind` of a
    parent (a Gateway), and the `group`, `kind` and `weight` of a backend (a
    core Service, weight 1).

  **Required,** by the rule of the infrastructure kinds above, is the `name`
  of a parent and of a backend that are authored (`parentRefs[0].name:
  required (…)`): the API requires it and the type would write it empty.

  **A required field the type omits is refused by the kind itself,** absent or
  authored empty, as the API server refuses the object:
  - a route with no `rules` (`rules: required (…)`);
  - a rule with no `backendRefs` (`rules[0].backendRefs: required (…)`);
  - a `tlsroute` with no `hostnames` (`hostnames: required (…)`).

  The `httproute` kind refuses none of these: the HTTPRoute API requires no
  rule, no backend and no host name.

  **A Service backend must name its port**
  (`rules[0].backendRefs[1].port: required (…)`). The CRDs write that as an
  expression rule, `(size(self.group) == 0 && self.kind == 'Service') ?
  has(self.port) : true`, which the API server evaluates after it has filled
  the defaults: a backend that names no `group` and no `kind` is a Service,
  and so is one that names the core group or the kind alone. A backend of
  another group or kind needs no port. It is the one expression rule the kinds
  hold, since it asks for a field that was left out, and the rule reads the
  same in both channels and on the three kinds.

  `TestGatewayKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds each required list (2 paths) and
  the refused omissions to the CRDs the linked module ships, as it does for
  the infrastructure kinds. `TestGatewayRouteKinds_OmissionsAreTheAPIServers`
  and `TestGatewayRouteKinds_ExpressionRules` go one step further: they run
  the CRD of each channel through the API server's own creation path
  (defaulting, the schema, the expression rules), and hold each refusal of a
  kind to a refusal of that path, and the object the kind emits for an
  accepted route to being accepted there. The second names every expression
  rule a CRD declares: the one above, which it shows with routes that break
  it and routes that keep it, or a rule left to the API server with its
  reason. A dependency bump that adds or rewrites a rule fails there.
  **Not refused:**
  - more than one rule, more than 16 backends in a rule, and every other
    value rule of the CRDs: lengths, patterns, minima, maxima and item limits;
  - the two expression rules on `parentRefs`, which tell two references to one
    parent apart (by `sectionName`, and in the experimental channel by `port`
    too). The channels write them differently, so a refusal by the kind would
    be wider than one of them;
  - the three expression rules on a TLSRoute's `hostnames` (a name is no IP
    address, it is a DNS name, and a wildcard is its first label alone): they
    hold the form of a value that is authored, as a pattern does;
  - what a Gateway API controller refuses when it reads the object, which
    shows in the object's status, not at creation.

  **A route is an authored object,** as an `httproute` is. A parent and a
  backend are references carried as written; launcher points neither at a
  component and does not look for the target in the document. To refer to
  another component's object, name it: the component name, or its
  `objectName`.
  - **References across namespaces are not gated.** `parentRefs[].namespace`
    and `backendRefs[].namespace` are written as authored, on the terms of the
    infrastructure kinds above and as the `httproute` kind writes them: by the
    Gateway API's documentation a route attaches only where the Gateway's
    listener allows routes of its namespace (`allowedRoutes`), and a backend of
    another namespace is used only where a ReferenceGrant of that namespace
    allows it; launcher checks neither.
  - **No NetworkPolicy allow rule.** As for `httproute` above: the
    NetworkPolicy synthesis reads a routing trait's traffic sources and target
    component, which these kinds do not report, so it allows nothing for a
    route's backends. An author who wants the allow rule authors the
    NetworkPolicy.
  - **No parent from a capability.** `parentRefs` is what the author wrote;
    unwritten, the route has no parent.

  **Policy.** No dimension of the environment policy reaches these objects:
  they run no pod, hold no image, request no storage and have no replica
  count, and no field of one holds a literal secret. A nil policy and a strict
  one build the same object. A TLSRoute's `hostnames` are names the route
  serves, not artifact sources, and are not held to the policy's allowed
  registries, as an HTTPRoute's are not. The policy's capability lists gate
  trait types, so none of them refuses a component of these types; a consumer
  that restricts routing restricts the component types it registers.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  **Not covered:** whether what is referred to exists (a Gateway, a listener,
  a Service and its port), whether the cluster's controller implements the
  route kind, and the object's `status`, which the controller writes.
- **secretstore**, **clustersecretstore**, **externalsecret**,
  **clusterexternalsecret** (go-kure/launcher#790) are the kind-named
  projections of four objects of the External Secrets Operator, in its
  `external-secrets.io/v1` API: a SecretStore, a ClusterSecretStore, an
  ExternalSecret and a ClusterExternalSecret. Each emits that one object,
  named after the component unless `objectName` names it; the handler adds no
  label, no annotation and no default. A `secretstore` and an `externalsecret`
  are built in the build namespace. **A `clustersecretstore` and a
  `clusterexternalsecret` are cluster-scoped**: the object carries no
  namespace, whatever namespace the application is built for, and its name is
  claimed cluster-wide. Nothing else is emitted: no Secret, ServiceAccount or
  generator a store or an external secret names, no store an external secret
  reads from, and not the ExternalSecrets a ClusterExternalSecret has the
  operator create. All four are built on `policyHeldKind`: the stores for the
  credentials a provider takes as a value, the two external-secret kinds for
  the one field that has the operator write another kind than a Secret
  (`target.manifest`, under **Policy** below).

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds.** Launcher does
  not ask whether the cluster runs the operator: where the CRDs are not
  installed the component builds, and the object is refused at apply. The
  cluster's `external-secret` capability is the trait's, and these kinds do
  not read it. Whoever may author a component may author these, a store that
  every namespace reads from and an external secret created in every selected
  namespace included. A policy can keep the kinds out of a build through the
  object kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922).

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (a provider, an authentication method, a `data` entry, a template).
  - `secretstore` and `clustersecretstore` (`SecretStoreSpec`, which the two
    objects share): `provider`, with one provider under its key (`aws`,
    `vault`, `kubernetes`, `webhook` and the others the API lists),
    `controller`, `retrySettings` (`maxRetries`, `retryInterval`),
    `refreshInterval` and `conditions` (`namespaceSelector`, `namespaces`,
    `namespaceRegexes`). The operator reads `conditions` on a
    ClusterSecretStore only; a `secretstore` that authors them carries them.
  - `externalsecret` (`ExternalSecretSpec`): `secretStoreRef` (`name`,
    `kind`), `target` (`name`, `creationPolicy`, `deletionPolicy`,
    `immutable`, `template`, `manifest`), `refreshPolicy`, `refreshInterval`,
    `syncWindows` (`kind`, `windows`), `data` (each a `secretKey`, a
    `remoteRef` and a `sourceRef`) and `dataFrom` (each an `extract`, a
    `find`, a `rewrite` and a `sourceRef`).
  - `clusterexternalsecret` (`ClusterExternalSecretSpec`):
    `externalSecretSpec` (the fields of an `externalsecret`),
    `externalSecretName`, `externalSecretMetadata` (`labels`, `annotations`),
    `namespaceSelector`, `namespaceSelectors`, `namespaces` and `refreshTime`.
  - A duration is written in the form the API type gives it:
    `refreshInterval: 1h` is emitted as `1h0m0s`, and so are a sync window's
    `duration` and a `clusterexternalsecret`'s `refreshTime`.
  - **No default is filled.** The API's defaults (an external secret's
    `refreshInterval`, a target's `creationPolicy` and `deletionPolicy`) are
    the API server's to fill where the field was not authored. The `kind` of a
    `secretStoreRef` has no default in the API: unset, it stays unset in the
    object, and is read as a SecretStore.
  - **No CRD default, read from its marker, replaces an authored `0` or
    `false`, except on three store fields, where the value is refused.** A
    default the operator applies itself is not covered. The type omits a zero in
    `provider.beyondtrust.server.decrypt`,
    `provider.infisical.secretsScope.expandSecretReferences` and
    `provider.onepasswordSDK.cache.maxSize`, and the API defaults each to
    another value (`true`, `true`, `100`), so the authored value would be
    replaced: `provider.infisical.secretsScope.expandSecretReferences: false
    cannot be carried by the external-secrets API types (the field is omitted
    when zero, so the API server would apply its default true)`.
    `TestExternalSecretsKinds_DefaultedZeros` holds that list to the default
    markers of the linked module's source in both directions: no other number
    or boolean of the four specs is of that shape.

  **Required** follows the rule of the Prometheus operator's kinds: a
  field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or not it was
  authored. Each must be authored; an authored empty value is a value, and the
  API server's to refuse. A required field under a parent the author left out
  is not asked for: the list follows what was authored.
  - **A store's `provider`, and inside the provider that is authored
    everything the API requires of it.** The list is not written by hand: it
    is generated from the types of the linked module
    (`zz_generated_externalsecrets_required.go`), 263 paths at this pin, over
    every provider the API has. `provider.vault.server`,
    `provider.aws.region`, `provider.aws.service`, `provider.webhook.url` and
    `provider.kubernetes.auth.serviceAccount.name` are five of them. The
    refusal names the path and says which of two things it is: `provider.vault.server:
    required (the external-secrets API requires this field)`, and for the
    `name` of a reference `provider.vault.caProvider.name: required (the
    external-secrets API requires the name of what this refers to)`.
  - **Four fields of a store the API would default, and the type always
    writes.** A default is applied to an absent field, and the object carries
    an empty one: the API's enumeration refuses an empty `version`, and an
    empty mount path or a cache lifetime of zero is not what the default
    would have been. So each must be written where its provider is authored:
    `provider.vault.version` and `provider.openBao.version` (the API's
    default is `v2`), `provider.vault.auth.cert.path` (`cert`) and
    `provider.onepasswordSDK.cache.ttl` (`5m`). **A Vault store therefore
    writes its `version`**: `provider.vault.version: required (the object
    always carries this field, so the external-secrets API's default v2 never
    applies: write the value)`. The four are generated into the same file, in
    a list of their own.
  - Of a match expression authored in a condition's `namespaceSelector`: its
    `key` and `operator`. Presence only: the operator's value and its
    `values` are left to the API server (see "A label selector's match
    expressions"). 2 paths, beside the generated ones.
  - An `externalsecret` has no required top-level field. Of what is authored:
    a `data` entry's `secretKey`, `remoteRef` and its `key`; the `key` of an
    `extract`; the `source` and `target` of a `rewrite`'s `regexp` and the
    `template` of its `transform`; the `kind` and `name` of a `generatorRef`;
    of `syncWindows` its `kind` and `windows`, and a window's `schedule` and
    `duration`; of a `target.manifest` its `apiVersion` and `kind`; of a
    ConfigMap or Secret a template is read from
    (`target.template.templateFrom[]`) its `name`, its `items` and an item's
    `key`. 23 paths.
  - A `clusterexternalsecret`: `externalSecretSpec`, and under it everything
    an `externalsecret` requires; and the `key` and `operator` of a match
    expression authored in `namespaceSelector` or in an entry of
    `namespaceSelectors`, presence only. 28 paths.
  - The published schema marks the two top-level ones as required
    (go-kure/launcher#790): `provider` of a `secretstore` and of a
    `clustersecretstore`, and `externalSecretSpec` of a
    `clusterexternalsecret`. That refuses no component that built before,
    since the kind refused each without it already.

  `TestExternalSecretsKinds_RequiredMatchSource` holds the three lists to the
  source of the linked module, which ships no CRD: the markers its CRDs are
  generated from are read from the Go files. A field counts as required where
  its json tag has no `omitempty` and it carries no optional marker, and as
  written unauthored where the Go type encodes it when it is unset. Of the
  Kubernetes types the specs embed, only a match expression's `key` and
  `operator` are derived, by the same rule on the source of the linked
  `metav1.LabelSelectorRequirement`; every other required field of such a
  type is not refused, and an omitted one is emitted empty.
  `TestExternalSecretsKinds_StoreRequiredIsGenerated` fails where the
  generated file and that derivation differ, in either direction and for
  either list, and names the path; a dependency bump that adds, drops or moves
  one fails there. Regenerate with `UPDATE_EXTERNALSECRETS_REQUIRED=1 go test
  ./pkg/oam/builtin/components/ -run
  TestExternalSecretsKinds_StoreRequiredIsGenerated`. No field of the four
  specs is required and omitted by the type when unauthored at this pin; the
  same test fails on the first one a bump brings.

  **The API's count and expression rules.** Every rule the source declares on
  a type these specs reach is classified in `TestExternalSecretsKinds_Rules`,
  which fails on one that is added or reworded. **Checked:**
  - a store configures exactly one provider (`provider: configures no
    provider; the API takes exactly one`; `provider: configures 2 providers
    (aws, vault); the API takes exactly one`). A provider key written as
    `null` configures nothing, as on the API server;
  - a generator is not named as the source of one key of `data`. The API
    takes exactly one of `storeRef` and `generatorRef` in that `sourceRef`,
    and the type writes `storeRef` whether or not it was authored
    (`data[0].sourceRef.generatorRef: cannot be carried: the API takes
    exactly one of storeRef and generatorRef here, and the object always
    carries a storeRef; read from a generator with
    dataFrom[].sourceRef.generatorRef`). A source of `dataFrom` takes a
    generator. On a `clusterexternalsecret` both paths are under
    `externalSecretSpec`.

  **Not checked**, and the API server's to refuse:
  - the count rule on ten other types, each "exactly one of these fields": a
    `rewrite`, the `sourceRef` of a `dataFrom` entry, and eight blocks of
    single providers (an authentication method, a reference, how a Yandex
    provider fetches an entry). The minimum of one on a `data` entry's
    `sourceRef` is met by the `storeRef` the object always carries;
  - the six counts over named fields, on three providers: `openBao` (at most
    one of `caBundle` and `caProvider`; exactly one authentication method
    under `auth`; exactly one of `roleId` and `roleRef` on an app role;
    exactly one of `serviceAccountRef` and `secretRef` on its Kubernetes
    authentication), `onepasswordSDK` (at most one of `vault` and
    `environment`) and `crd` (at most one of `auth` and `authRef`). The type
    omits each of those fields when unauthored, so the object carries what
    was authored and no more;
  - the thirteen rules written as expressions, each on one provider: Barbican
    (four), Pulumi (two), Secret Server (two), AWS, `crd`, Doppler, GitHub and
    Nebius;
  - every other value rule of the API: enumerations, patterns, lengths and
    minima;
  - **the rules of the operator's validating webhook,** which refuses more
    than the CRDs do: an external secret with neither `data` nor `dataFrom`,
    two `data` entries with one `secretKey`, a `deletionPolicy` its
    `creationPolicy` does not allow, a template of a bootstrap-token Secret
    or of a service-account-token Secret that names its service account, a
    `dataFrom` entry that sets none or several of its sources; a store whose
    `namespaceRegexes` do not compile, whose `refreshInterval` is no
    duration, or whose provider refuses its own configuration. Launcher
    repeats none of them, so
    an `externalsecret` with no property builds, and is refused at apply where
    the webhook runs.

  **What the type writes unauthored.** An empty block, `{}`, where the type
  holds one by value and the API does not require it: an external secret's
  `secretStoreRef` and `target`, a `clusterexternalsecret`'s
  `externalSecretMetadata`, an AWS provider's `auth` and a Vault provider's
  `tls`, among others. The API accepts each.
  `TestExternalSecretsKinds_WrittenUnauthored` pins those five.

  **Policy.**
  - **A credential written into a store is refused under a policy that
    forbids explicit secrets.** A few providers take a credential as a
    `value` beside the `secretRef` that names a Secret holding it, and the
    object is in the build's output: `provider.delinea.clientSecret.value:
    holds the credential in the object, and the environment policy forbids
    explicit secrets; name the key of a Secret created out of band in
    provider.delinea.clientSecret.secretRef instead`. The message quotes
    nothing of the value. Refused: `provider.beyondtrust.auth.apiKey`,
    `.auth.certificateKey` and `.auth.clientSecret`,
    `provider.delinea.clientSecret`, `provider.scaleway.secretKey`,
    `provider.secretserver.password` and `.token`. A policy that allows
    explicit secrets, one that does not answer the question and no policy
    build it.
  - **The same union holds an identifier on seven other fields, which are not
    refused:** `provider.barbican.auth.applicationCredentialID` and
    `.auth.username`, `provider.beyondtrust.auth.certificate` and
    `.auth.clientId`, `provider.delinea.clientId`,
    `provider.scaleway.accessKey` and `provider.secretserver.username`.
    `TestExternalSecretsKinds_InlineValues` finds every string `value` beside
    a `secretRef` in the linked module (14 at this pin) and fails on one that
    is in neither list.
  - **The data of the `fake` provider is refused under the same policy.**
    `provider.fake.data` is nothing but the values the store serves, and the
    provider has no reference to a Secret. The API also requires the field,
    and the two refusals come in this order: a `fake` provider with no `data`
    is refused as a required field, under every policy and under none; one
    with entries is refused as an explicit secret under a policy that forbids
    them; `data: []` passes both. `TestSecretStoreKinds_FakeData` pins the
    order.
  - **Text in which a reference and a literal look alike is not checked,** on
    any of the four and under any policy: a header or the body of a `webhook`
    provider's request, a header of a `vault` provider, the user part of a
    provider's URL, and the template of the Secret an external secret writes
    (`target.template.data`, a `templateFrom` literal, the template's
    metadata). A secret written there is in the build's output.
  - **No field of an external secret is a credential, and one field is
    checked: `target.manifest`.** An `externalsecret` and a
    `clusterexternalsecret` name what is read and where it is written, and
    `ApplyPolicy` fills nothing on either. With `target.manifest` (an
    `apiVersion` and a `kind`) the operator writes an object of that kind
    instead of a Secret, from template text it renders in the cluster. The
    `apiVersion` has to be an API version, a version (`v1`) or a group and a
    version (`apps/v1`), each part a name the API can have: the version a
    DNS-1035 label and the group a DNS-1123 subdomain, the bounds a
    CustomResourceDefinition's group and version names have. The core group
    is written without a slash, so `/v1`, `apps/` and `Apps/v1` are none.
    The API bounds the field by a minimum length only, nothing can write an
    object of a version that is none, and where the value does not split
    into the two its kind would read as no kind at all to the check below.
    One that is none is refused under every policy, and not as a policy
    refusal (`target.manifest.apiVersion: "apps/v1/x" is no API version:
    want a version (v1) or a group and a version (apps/v1)`). **That
    object gets no more than the same policy gives the same kind on
    `passthrough`.** What `passthrough` would read cannot be read at build,
    so a kind the rendered-object check reads anything from is refused, in
    any version and whatever the policy's own limits: a Pod, PodTemplate,
    ReplicationController, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet,
    Job, CronJob, PersistentVolumeClaim or PersistentVolume of the built-in
    groups, and a HorizontalPodAutoscaler: `target.manifest: the operator
    would write a Deployment, a kind the environment policy checks, and what
    the object would hold is not known at build, so it cannot be checked
    against environment policy` (on a `clusterexternalsecret` the path is
    `externalSecretSpec.target.manifest`). The transform applies `NoopPolicy`
    when no policy is passed, so this holds then too. **This is stricter than
    `passthrough`** wherever the policy would pass the object it read: a
    claim under a policy with no storage maximum, an autoscaler under one
    with no replica maximum, a workload within every limit. `passthrough`
    reads the object and finds nothing to refuse; here the content is not
    known at build, so there is nothing to read. A core `Secret` named
    there is refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets and passes
    under any other, as on `passthrough`. **Any other kind (a ConfigMap, a
    custom resource) passes as it would on `passthrough`**, and whether the
    operator writes it at all is the cluster's: the operator's generic-target
    setting and its RBAC. The `target` path of a `templateFrom` entry needs
    no check of its own: it places text inside the object `target.manifest`
    names. `TestPolicyReadsKind_IsWhatTheRenderedObjectCheckReads` fails when
    the refused set and the check differ.
  - **Hosts are not checked.** A host these objects name is one the operator
    reaches, not an artifact source, and none is held to the policy's allowed
    registries: the server, URL, host or endpoint of every provider
    (`provider.vault.server`, `provider.webhook.url`,
    `provider.kubernetes.server.url`, `provider.azurekv.vaultUrl`,
    `provider.conjur.url`, `provider.onepassword.connectHost` and the others).
  - A nil policy checks nothing.

  **The store of an external secret is the author's.** `secretStoreRef` names
  a store by `name` and `kind`; launcher points it at no component, fills
  none from the cluster's capability and does not look for the store in the
  document. To have a `secretstore` or `clustersecretstore` component serve
  an `externalsecret` component, name its object: the component name, or its
  `objectName`. The API reads a `secretStoreRef` without a `kind` as a
  SecretStore of the ExternalSecret's namespace. The Secret `target` names is
  the operator's to create, and the component emits none.

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties.
  The object also carries the component label, whose value is the component's
  (see "Component label and ownership" in the OAM model). The labels of the
  ExternalSecrets a ClusterExternalSecret creates are its
  `externalSecretMetadata`, and those of the Secret an external secret writes
  its `target.template.metadata`: the operator applies both, and launcher adds
  nothing to either.

  **Beside the `external-secret` trait.** The trait derives an ExternalSecret
  for the workload it is attached to, from a few properties and a store it
  names itself or takes from the cluster's `external-secret` capability, names
  it after its `secretName`, and mounts or injects the Secret into the
  workload. The `externalsecret` kind is the authored object, for what the
  trait does not express: the whole spec, and an ExternalSecret that belongs
  to no workload. The two type names differ (`external-secret`,
  `externalsecret`). The two objects are one kind: a trait's and a
  component's given one name in one namespace are refused (`generated-object
  collision: ExternalSecret.external-secrets.io "default/app-credentials" is
  generated by both …`).

  **Not covered.** The operator's other APIs: its generators and its
  PushSecret. Whether what is referred to exists (a store, a Secret and its
  key, a ServiceAccount, a ConfigMap, a generator, a namespace), and whether
  the operator can reach what a store names. The objects' status is the
  operator's and is not written.
- **replicationsource**, **replicationdestination** (go-kure/launcher#790)
  are the kind-named projections of the two objects of VolSync's
  `volsync.backube/v1alpha1` API: a ReplicationSource, which copies a volume
  out, and a ReplicationDestination, which receives one. Each is built on
  `policyHeldKind` (`policyFreeKind` with a policy check, see above) and
  emits that one object in the build namespace, named after the component
  unless `objectName` names it, and declares it as namespaced; the handler
  adds no label, no annotation and no default. The two share their movers but
  for Syncthing, and what is said of a mover below holds for both kinds.

  **No capability is required, and none gates these kinds.** Launcher does
  not ask whether the cluster serves `volsync.backube/v1alpha1`: where
  VolSync's CRDs are not installed the component builds, and the object is
  refused at apply. A policy can keep the kinds out of a build through the
  object kind policy (`oam.ObjectKindPolicy`, go-kure/launcher#922). The
  kinds read nothing of the cluster
  profile; the `volsync` trait still takes its class defaults from it.

  **Authored.** The properties are the top-level json fields of the spec type,
  decoded strictly at every depth: an unknown key is refused wherever it sits
  (a mover, its security context, a volume mounted into it).
  - `replicationsource` (`ReplicationSourceSpec`): `sourcePVC`, the claim to
    copy; `trigger` (`schedule`, a cron expression, or `manual`); the movers
    `rsync`, `rsyncTLS`, `rclone`, `restic` and `syncthing`; `external`, a
    provider outside VolSync with its `parameters`; and `paused`.
  - `replicationdestination` (`ReplicationDestinationSpec`): `trigger`, the
    movers `rsync`, `rsyncTLS`, `rclone` and `restic`, `external` and
    `paused`. A destination has no Syncthing mover and names no source claim:
    `syncthing` and `sourcePVC` are refused there as unknown keys.
  - `rsync` (rsync over SSH) has its own, shorter type: it takes
    `moverResources`, `moverServiceAccount` and `moverPodLabels`, and has no
    `moverSecurityContext`, `moverAffinity` or `moverVolumes`, which are
    refused under it as unknown keys.
  - A mover authored empty is in the object, empty but for what the type
    writes unauthored (below); one left out is not.
  - An authored `false` or `0` is kept where the API tells it from an unset
    field (`restic.retain.monthly: 0`, a destination's `restic.previous: 0`,
    a Syncthing peer's `introducer: false`, `moverSecurityContext.runAsUser:
    0`), and left out where the type omits a zero (`paused: false`).
    VolSync's CRDs default no field under `spec`, so no authored zero is
    replaced by a CRD default; `TestVolsyncKinds_NoDefaults` holds the linked
    CRDs to that, and a dependency bump that adds a default fails there with
    the field named.

  **Required** follows the rule of the Prometheus operator's kinds: a
  field the API requires that the Go type writes whether or not it was
  authored must be authored. Neither kind has one at the top level.
  - Of a volume mounted into a mover (`moverVolumes`, on `rsyncTLS`,
    `rclone`, `restic` and `syncthing`): `mountPath` and `volumeSource`
    (`restic.moverVolumes[0].volumeSource: required (…)`).
  - Of a Syncthing peer: `address`, `ID` and `introducer`. No default is
    filled for `introducer`: an authored `false` is a value.
  - Of a mover's affinity that authors a required node affinity
    (`moverAffinity.nodeAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`):
    its `nodeSelectorTerms`, which the Kubernetes type would write as `null`
    where the CRD requires them. `TestKindComponents_NullRequired` shows the
    refusal with the validator of the linked CRDs.
  - Of a match expression that is authored in a label selector of a mover's
    pod affinity or anti-affinity (`moverAffinity`, on `rsyncTLS`, `rclone`,
    `restic` and `syncthing`): `key` and `operator`. Presence only: the
    operator's value and its `values` are left to the API server (see "A
    label selector's match expressions").
  - A required field under a parent the author left out is not asked for: the
    list follows what was authored.

  `TestVolsyncKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds the lists (75 paths for a source,
  54 for a destination) to the CRDs the linked module ships: every field of
  VolSync's own types that a CRD requires and the type writes unauthored is
  listed, and so is the `key` and `operator` of a match expression, and
  nothing else is. A dependency bump that adds, drops or moves one fails
  there. **Not refused:**
  - a required field the type omits when it is not authored: the object shows
    the omission, and the API server refuses it;
  - a required field of a Kubernetes type these specs embed, other than those
    terms and a match expression's two fields (the `key` of a node selector
    requirement in an affinity, for one). An omitted one is emitted empty;
  - every other value rule of the CRDs (enumerations, patterns, minima).

  **Two fields the linked Kubernetes type holds and the CRDs do not are
  refused when authored:** `<mover>.moverVolumes[].volumeSource.secret.defaultUser`
  and `<mover>.moverVolumes[].volumeSource.secret.items[].user`, an authored
  `0` included (`rclone.moverVolumes[0].volumeSource.secret.defaultUser: no
  field of the volsync.backube/v1alpha1 API: its CRD has no such property`).
  The linked Kubernetes API is newer than the one VolSync's CRDs were
  generated from: the Go type of a mounted Secret has the two fields, the
  strict decode reads the Go type, and the CRDs have no property for either.
  `TestVolsyncKinds_AbsentFromCRD` derives the fields the types reach that
  the linked CRDs have no property for and holds the refusals to them, both
  ways: a bump of either module that closes the gap, or widens it, fails
  there with the field named. It also runs the API server's own create
  sequence on the linked CRDs (`crdCreate`): the API server names each of the
  two as an unknown field, for which a request made with strict field
  validation is refused, and prunes it from the object it goes on with.

  **The CRDs declare no expression rule** (`x-kubernetes-validations`), so
  the kinds check none; `TestVolsyncKinds_NoExpressionRules` holds the linked
  CRDs to that, and a dependency bump that adds one fails there with the rule
  named.

  **What the type writes unauthored.** `customCA: {}` on an authored `rclone`
  or `restic` mover, which holds it by value. The CRDs accept it empty, and
  `TestVolsyncKinds_RequiredMatchCRD` holds every such field to its schema.

  **Policy.**
  - **An authored capacity is held to the storage maximum.** A mover's
    `capacity` (on `rsync`, `rsyncTLS`, `rclone` and `restic`) sizes a volume
    the operator provisions: on a source the point-in-time image of the
    volume, on a destination the volume the data is received into.
    `restic.cacheCapacity` sizes Restic's metadata cache volume and, on a
    source, `syncthing.configCapacity` Syncthing's configuration volume. Each
    is held to the environment policy's storage maximum: `component "web":
    restic.capacity "20Gi" exceeds enforced maximum "10Gi"`. A capacity the
    author left out is the operator's to choose and is not held; the policy's
    default storage size is not filled.
  - **A mover's cpu and memory are held to the maxima.** The limits and
    requests of `moverResources` are held to the policy's cpu and memory
    maxima, as a container's are, on every mover: `component "web":
    rsync.moverResources: cpu limit "4" exceeds enforced maximum "2"`. No
    default is filled: the policy's default requests and limits are a
    workload's. A request above its limit is not refused here.
  - **A mover's `hostProcess` switch is refused unless the policy allows
    privileged workloads.** `moverSecurityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess:
    true` runs the mover's containers as Windows HostProcess containers:
    `component "web": restic.moverSecurityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess
    is not allowed by environment policy`. An authored `false` builds. With
    no policy passed it is refused too, since `NoopPolicy` allows nothing
    privileged.
  - **The `rsync` mover is held to the policy's container capabilities.**
    Authoring the rsync-over-SSH mover is itself a choice of privilege: the
    linked operator version (VolSync v0.16.0) runs its container as root
    (`runAsUser: 0`), not privileged, with every capability dropped and seven
    added (`AUDIT_WRITE`, `CHOWN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `FOWNER`, `SETGID`,
    `SETUID`, `SYS_CHROOT`), on a source and on a destination alike, and its
    builder does not take the namespace's answer on privileged movers. An
    authored `rsync` mover, whatever it holds, is therefore held to the
    policy's allowed and forbidden container capabilities for those seven,
    as a container that adds them is on a pod kind: `component "web": rsync:
    the mover's container as VolSync v0.16.0 writes it:
    securityContext.capabilities.add: "SYS_CHROOT" is forbidden by
    environment policy`. A policy that sets neither list, and no policy,
    build it; allowing privileged workloads does not lift a forbidden
    capability, as it does not on a pod kind. Two limits. The seven are what
    the **linked** operator version writes
    (`internal/controller/mover/rsync/mover.go` in its module): a cluster
    that runs another version of the operator may add other capabilities, and
    the kind does not know. `TestVolsyncKinds_RsyncCapabilities` reads that
    literal and holds the non-test Go source of the two packages the
    container is built in (`internal/controller/mover/rsync` and
    `internal/controller/utils`) to a stated digest: a dependency bump that
    changes either package fails, whatever the change, until a person has
    re-read the mover and restated the digest. The test cannot check that the
    re-reading was done; a bump that touches either package needs it even
    when the container is untouched; and the module's other packages and the
    functions of other modules that the mover calls are outside the digest.
    And that the container runs as root is stated here, not held: the policy
    has no dimension for it.
  - **Not held:** the rest of `moverSecurityContext`. It is a pod security
    context, and of it only `windowsOptions.hostProcess` is held: the user
    and groups the mover runs as, its sysctls and its SELinux and seccomp
    settings are written as authored, since the environment policy has no
    dimension for them. The service account the mover runs under
    (`moverServiceAccount`, on every mover) is an identity carried as
    authored. Nor are held a mover's affinity; the volumes mounted into it
    (`moverVolumes`: a Secret, a claim or an NFS export; the type holds no
    host path); the type of the Service a mover is reached through
    (`serviceType`); and whether an `rsyncTLS`, `rclone`, `restic` or
    `syncthing` mover runs with elevated permissions, which is no field of
    the object: an administrator sets it with an annotation on the namespace
    (`volsync.backube/privileged-movers`), which the linked operator's
    controllers read and hand to the builder of each of those four movers.
    The `rsync` mover's builder drops that answer (above).
  - **Hosts are not checked.** A host these objects name is one the mover
    reaches, not an artifact source, and none is held to the policy's allowed
    registries: `rsync.address`, `rsyncTLS.address`, a Syncthing peer's
    `address`, and the `server` of an NFS export among `moverVolumes`.
  - **No field holds a literal secret by design, and none is checked.** A
    credential is the name of a Secret (`restic.repository`,
    `rclone.rcloneConfig`, `rsync.sshKeys`, `rsyncTLS.keySecret`). The
    `parameters` of an `external` provider are a map of strings the provider
    reads: they are written as authored and not checked, under a policy that
    forbids explicit secrets too.

  **The operator's own rule is not repeated.** When it reconciles, VolSync
  refuses an object that configures no replication method or more than one
  (`a replication method must be specified`, `only one replication method
  can be supplied`). Launcher does not: such a component builds, and the
  rule stays the operator's.

  **Beside the `volsync` trait.** The trait derives a ReplicationSource for a
  claim of the workload it is attached to, a Restic backup on a schedule,
  and names it `<sourcePVC>-backup`. The `replicationsource` kind is the
  authored object, for what the trait does not express: the whole spec, any
  mover, a source that belongs to no workload. No trait builds a
  ReplicationDestination. The trait's object and a `replicationsource`
  component's are one kind: given one name in one namespace they are refused
  (`generated-object collision: ReplicationSource.volsync.backube
  "default/data-backup" is generated by both …`).

  **Labels and annotations** are the `labels` and `annotations` properties. A
  mover's `moverPodLabels` are not these: they are labels the operator adds to
  the mover pods. They are held as a pod's labels are: the component label's
  key holds the component's value there or the build is refused, and a key the
  consumer reserved is refused (`mover pod label "…" may not be set`); see
  "Component label and ownership" and "Reserved metadata keys" in the OAM
  model. Launcher writes nothing there. A destination's `serviceAnnotations`
  reach a Service and are not read.

  **Not covered.** Whether what is referred to exists (the claim to copy, a
  Secret, a storage or snapshot class, a ServiceAccount), and whether the
  mover can reach what the object names. The object's status is the
  operator's and is not written.
- **statefulset** — `serviceName` and `volumeClaimTemplates`
  (`name`, `mountPath` or — for a `volumeMode: Block` claim — `devicePath`,
  `size`, `storageClass`, `accessModes`, plus the rest of
  `corev1.PersistentVolumeClaimSpec`; see "Raw block volumes" above). The
  StatefulSetSpec-level and
  claim-template field sets are classified in "StatefulSet-level and
  claim-template properties" below. `ports` declares the main container's
  ports (see "Main container ports"). It emits no Service
  (go-kure/launcher#690). For scheduling it takes `affinity`, `tolerations`
  and `topologySpreadConstraints` as the raw `corev1` shapes
  (go-kure/launcher#790, see "Raw scheduling properties" above); the four-key
  `affinity` shorthand is not published on this kind.
  - **`serviceName` names the governing Service, which the component does
    not emit.** Author it as a headless `service` component (`clusterIP:
    None`, selecting `app: <component>`) and name it here. It has no default:
    unset, the StatefulSet carries `serviceName: ""`. An authored value must be
    a valid Service name, a DNS-1035 label (at most 63 characters, lowercase
    letters, digits and `-`, starting with a letter and ending with a letter
    or digit), and is refused at conversion otherwise (`serviceName: "api.v1"
    is not a valid Service name, which must be a DNS-1035 label`,
    go-kure/launcher#546); `Generate` applies the same rule to the config's
    `ServiceName`. Before go-kure/launcher#690 `serviceName` defaulted to the
    component name and the component emitted that headless Service itself;
    "Main container ports" has the migration, including why an existing
    StatefulSet must be recreated.
  - **A route to the pods names the authored Service.** With no Service of
    its own, the component is no implicit backend: an `ingress`, `httproute`
    or `expose` without a `backend` on it is refused (`component "<name>"
    has no service port`). Put the trait on the authored `service`, or name
    that Service as the trait's `backend`.
- **daemonset** — `tolerations` (`key`/`operator`/`value`/`effect`/`tolerationSeconds`;
  `tolerationSeconds` and the toleration cross-field rules arrived with
  go-kure/launcher#412 via the shared parser — see "What `tolerations` changed
  for `daemonset`" above, which is the only place in this work that is not
  additive); `ports` declares the main container's ports (see "Main container
  ports"). It emits no Service (go-kure/launcher#690): author a `service`
  component selecting `app: <component>` to expose the pods, and put routing
  traits on it. Since go-kure/launcher#790 it also publishes the raw `affinity`
  and `topologySpreadConstraints` (see "Raw scheduling properties") and
  `sidecars`, read, checked and enforced exactly as on `statefulset`: the same
  closed entry, the same pod-wide port-name check against the main container's
  `ports`, and the same `ApplyPolicy` loop. A sidecar here runs on every node
  the DaemonSet schedules to.
  DaemonSetSpec-level (go-kure/launcher#340, `daemonset_spec.go`): `updateStrategy`,
  `minReadySeconds`, `revisionHistoryLimit`. `appsv1.DaemonSetSpec` has five
  fields; `template` is the pod projection above and `selector` is
  builder-managed, which leaves these three.

  Before go-kure/launcher#690, `port > 0` added a ClusterIP Service named after
  the component, which held the component name to the Service-name rule and an
  ingress `portName` to `http` (go-kure/launcher#545, go-kure/launcher#546).
  With no Service, only the container-name rule applies (see
  **webservice / worker**).

  | Property | Type | Effect | Compatibility |
  |----------|------|--------|---------------|
  | `updateStrategy` | object | `type` (**required**, `RollingUpdate`\|`OnDelete`) and `rollingUpdate` (`maxUnavailable`, `maxSurge`), only accepted under `type: RollingUpdate`. `type: RollingUpdate` alone is accepted — the apiserver defaults the `rollingUpdate` object that upstream validation then requires. | additive |
  | `minReadySeconds` | int ≥ 0 | Seconds a new pod must stay ready before it counts as available. | additive |
  | `revisionHistoryLimit` | int ≥ 0 | Superseded ControllerRevisions kept for rollback. | additive |
  | `selector` | — | **Rejected outright**, not silently dropped: the selector is builder-managed (`app: <component>`), must equal the generated template labels, and is immutable once created. | **Behavior-changing** |
  | `template` | — | **Rejected outright** (go-kure/launcher#790), as on `deployment`: the pod template is projected from the component's own container and pod-level properties. A document was refused already, by the authored-property check; the parser now refuses it too, where a caller that skips that check had it dropped. | **Behavior-changing** for such a caller |

  `maxUnavailable` and `maxSurge` each accept a non-negative integer or a `"N%"`
  string with N ≤ 100 (the integer form is a pod count and is deliberately
  uncapped, matching upstream's `IsNotMoreThan100Percent`, which inspects only
  percentages). A leading sign (`"+50%"`) is rejected — upstream's own
  `IsValidPercent` form check is used rather than a `TrimSuffix`/`Atoi` pair,
  which would accept it. Unlike the statefulset kind, whose `maxUnavailable`
  "cannot be 0", either DaemonSet knob may be zero on its own; it is the
  **pair** that must have exactly one non-zero member. That rule is enforced
  against the *effective* pair, counting the API defaults for whichever half the
  document leaves out — `maxUnavailable` 1, `maxSurge` 0
  (`k8s.io/api/apps/v1/types.go`, the `RollingUpdateDaemonSet` field docs). So
  `maxSurge: 2` on its own is rejected here rather than at apply time (the
  defaulted `maxUnavailable: 1` makes both non-zero), and using surge means
  writing `maxUnavailable: 0` alongside it. The error names which half was
  defaulted, since that is the half absent from the author's YAML.

  Both knobs are published as the `Types: [integer, string]` union
  (go-kure/launcher#383), so the integer and the percentage form both pass
  property validation on the authored and the emitted path alike, and a value of
  any other type is rejected there before the parser sees it. The union leaves
  `Type` empty, so a schema consumer that does not read `Types` still accepts
  both forms.

  **Two rules here are deliberately stricter than upstream.** The API accepts
  both shapes; what it does with them differs. `updateStrategy.type` is required
  here, where the API defaults it to `RollingUpdate` and acts on that — so a bare
  `updateStrategy: {}` is a legal document whose entire meaning comes from
  defaulting rather than from anything written. `updateStrategy.rollingUpdate` is
  refused under `type: OnDelete`, where `ValidateDaemonSetUpdateStrategy`'s
  `OnDelete` branch is empty and the field is accepted and never read — the
  silently-ignored knob this projection exists to remove. Both are still
  *additive*: `updateStrategy` is a new
  property, so no document that built before this change can carry either shape.
  In the other direction the parser is laxer in exactly one place — upstream
  requires a non-nil `rollingUpdate` under `RollingUpdate`, but apiserver
  defaulting satisfies that, not the author, so `type: RollingUpdate` alone is
  accepted (the same reasoning the statefulset kind applies to its own optional
  `rollingUpdate`).

  Every accepted property is presence-gated: a document authoring none of them
  produces byte-identical output to before, because `DaemonSetSpecConfig.apply`
  writes only the fields that were authored. The one behavior change is
  `selector`: a `selector:` on a daemonset used to be silently ignored — before
  go-kure/launcher#408 (closed), authored-document validation checked type
  names and identity, not property shape — and now fails the build, both
  because `daemonset` does not declare the key and because `ValidateAuthoredProperties`
  (`pkg/cmd/kurel/build.go:149`) now rejects an undeclared authored key on its
  own. That is the point — a silently dropped selector reads as applied.

  It is a behavior change against what the code did, not against what the format
  promised. `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` § Parser Strictness already states the
  contract — "Launcher rejects unknown fields in all launcher-native documents.
  An `app.yaml`, `kurel.yaml`, or `cluster.yaml` with unrecognised keys is a
  build error" — so a daemonset carrying `selector:` was never a valid
  `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1` document, and the same-version stability promise
  ("every document that was **valid** under it remains valid") never covered it.
  The authored path simply had not implemented that strictness for this key; the
  rejection implements it, with a message that says why rather than the generic
  unknown-key error. `6aed090` (`feat(format): enforce policy and support
  securityContext on init/sidecar containers`) is the in-repo precedent for
  shipping this class of tightening under an unchanged version string.
- **cronjob** — `schedule` accepts a standard 5-field cron expression (e.g.
  `0 2 * * *`; not 6-field — a seconds field is rejected), one of the fixed
  `@`-descriptors (`@yearly`, `@annually`, `@monthly`, `@weekly`, `@daily`,
  `@midnight`, `@hourly`; `@reboot` is rejected, meaningless for a CronJob),
  or `@every <duration>` (e.g. `@every 1h30m`, validated via Go's
  `time.ParseDuration` — a malformed duration is rejected, not merely
  regex-matched). `restartPolicy` (default `OnFailure`),
  `successfulJobsHistoryLimit`/`failedJobsHistoryLimit`. `ports` declares
  container ports, and emits no Service (see "Main container ports"). No
  `sidecars` schema key (init containers only): a plain sidecar keeps running
  after the main container exits, so the Job's pod would never complete. The
  container that fits is the restartable init container, which this package
  does not model (see "Container fields"). Since go-kure/launcher#790 it
  publishes the raw `affinity`, `tolerations` and `topologySpreadConstraints`
  (see "Raw scheduling properties"), written onto the Job template's pod
  template.
  CronJobSpec-level: `concurrencyPolicy` (`Allow`|`Forbid`|`Replace`; the API's
  own default is `Allow`, but this is only ever written when authored —
  `ConcurrencyPolicy` has no `omitempty`, so writing it unconditionally would
  add the key to every generated CronJob), `suspend`, `startingDeadlineSeconds`
  (`>= 0`), `timeZone` (a real IANA zone name, e.g. `Europe/Brussels`; an
  authored empty string is rejected outright, `Local` is rejected
  case-insensitively even though Go's own `time.LoadLocation("Local")`
  succeeds — Kubernetes' CronJob validation rejects it as server-dependent —
  and any other value is checked via `time.LoadLocation`, which this binary
  resolves from an embedded IANA database rather than the host's zoneinfo).
  JobSpec-level (projected onto `spec.jobTemplate.spec`, shared with the `job`
  component — the full table is under **job**, and the shared trio is
  described in "Common config" above): `backoffLimit`, `completions`,
  `parallelism`, `activeDeadlineSeconds`, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`,
  `completionMode`, `backoffLimitPerIndex`, `maxFailedIndexes`,
  `podReplacementPolicy`, `managedBy`, `successPolicy`, `podFailurePolicy`.
  `suspend` on a cronjob
  is the **CronJobSpec** field, not the JobSpec one — see the `suspend` note in
  "Common config". Every CronJobSpec-level and JobSpec-level field above except
  `restartPolicy` and the two history limits is presence-gated: omitting it
  never adds a key to the generated output, even where the corresponding
  Kubernetes default (e.g. `concurrencyPolicy: Allow`) would otherwise appear
  to have been authored. Those three are always written, taking `OnFailure`, 3
  and 1 when omitted.
  The CronJob's name is at most 52 characters, the longest the API server
  creates one under (`ValidateCronJobCreate`: the controller names each Job
  after the CronJob plus an 11-character suffix, and that Job's name is held to
  63). The rule is held on the name the CronJob takes, the component name or
  its `objectName` (or the `Naming` hook's answer), when the component is read
  and again at `Generate`: `cronjob "<name>": the component name is the
  CronJob's name, which must be at most 52 characters: it has 53`, or
  `objectName (or the Naming hook's answer for role "object"): "<name>" is not
  a valid CronJob name, which must be at most 52 characters: it has 53`. A
  component named with 53 to 63 characters built before this rule and is
  refused now (go-kure/launcher#787); a longer one was already refused by the
  container-name rule. With an Indexed job template the name must also leave
  room for the index in each pod's hostname, a limit that applies when the
  controller creates the Job, not when the CronJob is admitted; the build does
  not check it.
  Known limitation: the plain 5-field `schedule` form accepts any 5
  whitespace-separated tokens with no per-field semantic check (e.g.
  `99 99 99 99 99` builds successfully here and is only rejected later, by
  Kubernetes' own API server) — this is deliberate, not an oversight: tightening
  it would reject documents that build successfully today, which is a breaking
  change under this project's additive-compatibility rule (see
  `docs/oam/design-gvk.md`).
- **job** (go-kure/launcher#344, `job.go`) — a run-to-completion workload:
  `image`, `restartPolicy` (default `OnFailure`; the Job API rejects `Always`,
  which is what pod defaulting would otherwise supply, and a present-but-
  non-string or empty value is refused rather than read as an omission that
  would silently restore that default), and the shared container
  and pod-level surface above. No `port` and no Service; `ports` declares
  container ports (see "Main container ports"), and only then may a probe or
  hook name a port; no `sidecars` schema key (init containers only), matching
  `cronjob` and for the reason given there. Since go-kure/launcher#790 it
  publishes the raw `affinity`, `tolerations` and `topologySpreadConstraints`
  (see "Raw scheduling properties"), written onto the Job's pod template.
  It emits a `Job` and nothing else (go-kure/launcher#702).

  The Job's name is at most 63 characters: the API server writes it as the
  value of the pod template's `job-name` and `batch.kubernetes.io/job-name`
  labels (`generateSelector`), and a label value is at most 63. The rule is
  held on the name the Job takes, the component name or its `objectName` (or
  the `Naming` hook's answer), when the component is read and again at
  `Generate`, in the words the `cronjob` rule uses. A component name over 63
  characters was already refused at generation, by the container-name rule; it
  is now refused when the component is read, by this one
  (go-kure/launcher#787).

  On a job with `completionMode: Indexed` and `completions` above 0 the name is
  held to one more rule of the API server's (`validateNameAllowsCompletions`):
  the pod of each index takes the hostname `<name>-<index>`, so
  `<name>-<completions-1>` must be a DNS-1123 label, at most 63 characters and
  without a dot. It is held at the same two places, and refused as `job
  "<name>": the component name is the Job's name, and with completionMode
  Indexed and completions 11 the pod of the last index takes the hostname
  "<name>-10", which must be a DNS-1123 label: …`. An Indexed job whose name
  leaves no room for its last index built before this rule and is refused now.
  A document cannot leave `completions` unset on an Indexed job, but a
  `JobConfig` built in Go can: with `Parallelism` unset too the API server
  reads both as 1, so `Generate` holds the name to `<name>-0` there.

  The twelve JobSpec-level properties are the ones `cronjob` projects onto its
  job template, projected here onto `spec` directly. Every one is
  presence-gated, so a document authoring none of them emits no key for them.

  | Property | Type | Effect | Compatibility |
  |----------|------|--------|---------------|
  | `backoffLimit` | int ≥ 0 | Retries before the job is marked failed. API default 6, or 2147483647 when `backoffLimitPerIndex` is set. | additive |
  | `completions` | int ≥ 0 | Successful pods required. Required under `completionMode: Indexed`. | additive |
  | `parallelism` | int ≥ 0 | Pods running at once. ≤ 100000 under `Indexed`; ≤ 10000 when `completions` > 100000 and `backoffLimitPerIndex` is set. `0` runs no pods at all. | additive |
  | `activeDeadlineSeconds` | int > 0 | Seconds the job may run. Must be **positive** — `0` is rejected, not just negatives. Distinct from the pod-level `podActiveDeadlineSeconds`. | additive |
  | `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` | int ≥ 0 | Seconds after finishing before the job and its pods are deleted. | additive |
  | `completionMode` | `NonIndexed`\|`Indexed` | How completions are counted. `Indexed` requires `completions`. | additive |
  | `backoffLimitPerIndex` | int ≥ 0 | Retries within one index. Requires `Indexed`. | additive |
  | `maxFailedIndexes` | int ≥ 0 | Failed indexes tolerated before the whole job fails. Requires `backoffLimitPerIndex` (and so `Indexed`); ≤ `completions` and ≤ 100000, or ≤ 10000 (and required) when `completions` > 100000. | additive |
  | `podReplacementPolicy` | `Failed`\|`TerminatingOrFailed` | When a replacement pod is created. An empty string is rejected rather than treated as unset, for the same reason as `managedBy` below. | additive |
  | `managedBy` | string | Controller reconciling this job instead of the built-in one. A domain-prefixed path (`example.com/controller`), ≤ 63 characters. An empty string is rejected rather than treated as unset. | additive |
  | `successPolicy` | object | `rules[]` (1..20) of `succeededIndexes` (increasing comma-separated intervals, every index < `completions`) and/or `succeededCount` (≤ `completions`, and ≤ the number of indexes named alongside it). Requires `Indexed`. An empty `succeededIndexes` is rejected rather than treated as unset: it denotes no indexes at all, so it would otherwise satisfy the at-least-one-field rule while naming nothing. | additive |
  | `podFailurePolicy` | object | `rules[]` (0..20), each with an `action` (`FailJob`\|`FailIndex`\|`Ignore`\|`Count`) and **exactly one** of `onExitCodes` (`operator` `In`\|`NotIn`, `values[]` of 1..255 exit codes in increasing order without duplicates, optional `containerName`) or `onPodConditions[]` (up to 20 `type`/`status` patterns; an omitted or null `status` defaults to `True`, an empty one is rejected). An empty `onPodConditions: []` alone is neither; beside `onExitCodes` it is both, as the rule's published `exclusive` group counts it (go-kure/launcher#790). Requires `restartPolicy: Never`, and pins `podReplacementPolicy` to `Failed` when that is also authored. `FailIndex` additionally requires `backoffLimitPerIndex`. | **Behavior-changing** on `cronjob` (see below); additive on `job` |
  | `suspend` | bool | **`JobSpec.Suspend`** — create the job with no pods. Not the same field as `cronjob`'s `suspend`; see the `suspend` note in "Common config". | additive |
  | `selector`, `manualSelector`, `template` | — | **Rejected outright**, not silently dropped: the Job selector is generated by the job controller from a unique per-job label, and a hand-written one adopts other jobs' pods. `manualSelector` only has meaning alongside one. `template` is replaced wholesale from the component's own container and pod-level properties, so an authored one is discarded rather than merged — the same rejection the deployment kind makes. `cronjob` refuses the three as well (go-kure/launcher#790): its job is the same JobSpec, and its parser read none of them and said nothing. | **Behavior-changing** (see below) |
  | `scheduling` | — | **Rejected outright** on `job` and `cronjob` (go-kure/launcher#790): alpha upstream, behind the `WorkloadWithJob` feature gate, and read by neither. | **Behavior-changing** for a caller that skips the authored-property check |
  | `schedule`, `timeZone`, `concurrencyPolicy`, `startingDeadlineSeconds`, `successfulJobsHistoryLimit`, `failedJobsHistoryLimit` | — | **Rejected outright**: these are the CronJobSpec-only keys, and they are exactly what a `cronjob` document retyped to `job` leaves behind. Dropping them silently would run at apply time the work a schedule deferred (see below). | additive (no valid `job` document ever carried them) |

  Every cross-field rule above is ported from `ValidateJobSpec`
  (`k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apis/batch/validation`) at the pinned
  `k8s.io/api` version, so a document this parser accepts is one the API server
  accepts too — the rejections move an apply-time failure to build time. One
  upstream constraint is deliberately **not** enforced: `BackoffLimitPerIndex`'s
  field doc says per-index backoff only applies when the pod restart policy is
  `Never`, but `ValidateJobSpec` does not check it and neither does this parser
  — the schema description carries the constraint instead. Refusing a
  combination the API server accepts would be this projection inventing a rule,
  which is a different thing from the daemonset kind's `updateStrategy`
  strictness, where upstream accepts a field and then provably never reads it.

  Two rejections go the other way — stricter than `ValidateJobSpec`, because the
  field's own documented contract in `k8s.io/api/batch/v1` is stricter than the
  validator that is supposed to enforce it. `activeDeadlineSeconds: 0` is refused
  although the validator only requires non-negative, because the field doc says
  "value must be positive integer". An empty `successPolicy.rules[].succeededIndexes`
  is refused although the validator's index parser returns "no indexes, no error"
  for it, because the field doc says "At least one element is required". Both
  follow the documented contract rather than the gap in its enforcement. A third,
  `podFailurePolicy.rules[].onPodConditions[].status: ""`, is covered with
  `podFailurePolicy` below. These three are called out here because they are the
  only places a document this parser refuses would in fact have applied.

  `podFailurePolicy` (go-kure/launcher#345) is published by both `job` and
  `cronjob`, through the same shared parser as the rest of the table. Its rules
  are ported from `validatePodFailurePolicy` / `validatePodFailurePolicyRule`,
  with the differences below.

  **Two checks run at emission rather than at parse time**, in
  `validateJobPodFailurePolicyAgainstTemplate`, because both read the built pod
  template rather than the property map: upstream requires
  `restartPolicy: Never` alongside a `podFailurePolicy` (these components
  default it to `OnFailure`, so a document authoring only the policy is refused
  with a message naming the restart policy), and `onExitCodes.containerName`
  must name a container the template actually carries — the component's own
  container or one of its `initContainers`. Checking the emitted template rather
  than the config is what keeps the check from drifting from what is written,
  the same reason the component-name check in `createJob` reads the emitted
  name.

  **One place this parser is deliberately no stricter than upstream**: an empty
  `rules` list is accepted. `validatePodFailurePolicy` has no "at least one
  rule" check — unlike `validateSuccessPolicy`, which does — and
  `PodFailurePolicy.Rules`' own field doc states only the cap, so unlike
  `activeDeadlineSeconds` and `succeededIndexes` above there is no documented
  contract to follow past the validator. An empty list is not inert either: a
  non-nil policy pins `podReplacementPolicy` and `restartPolicy` whatever its
  rules say.

  **`onPodConditions[].status` defaults to `True`** (go-kure/launcher#410): a
  pattern that omits the key, or sets it to null, compiles to an explicit
  `status: "True"`, the value upstream's
  `SetDefaults_PodFailurePolicyOnPodConditionsPattern` fills in before
  validation. It is written out rather than left to the API server because the
  field carries no `omitempty`, so an unset one would be emitted as
  `status: ""`. An authored empty string is still refused, which is
  deliberately **stricter than upstream** — its defaulter fills `""` too — on
  the reading that an empty value is more likely a templating slip than a
  request for `True`. The default is additive: it only makes previously
  refused documents valid, and every previously valid document compiles
  identically.

  **Compatibility.** On `job` this is additive — the component type is newer
  than the key. On `cronjob` it is **behavior-changing**, and the reason is
  worth stating precisely: before this change an authored `podFailurePolicy` on
  a cronjob was not refused, it was **ignored**. At the time, property-schema
  validation ran on emitted elements only, never on authored documents, so a
  key no handler read was dropped in silence. A cronjob document that was
  already authoring `podFailurePolicy` therefore either compiles to a CronJob
  that now carries the policy, or stops building — most likely on the
  `restartPolicy: Never` requirement, since the component defaults to
  `OnFailure`. Under the additive test in `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` ("every
  previously valid document remains valid *and* compiles to the same output")
  that was not additive. The gap that made this true of *every* property ever
  added to an existing kind — the authored path not enforcing the Parser
  Strictness that document promises — belonged to the repo rather than to this
  change, and is fixed as go-kure/launcher#408 (closed): `kurel build` now
  calls `ValidateAuthoredProperties` (`pkg/cmd/kurel/build.go:149`), which
  checks declared keys and shapes on the authored document directly.

  The `selector`/`manualSelector` rejection is the same class of change the
  daemonset kind's `selector` rejection is, and rests on the same reasoning:
  `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` § Parser Strictness already promises that unknown
  fields in a launcher-native document are a build error, so neither key was
  ever part of a valid `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1` job. Here it is not even a
  tightening — `job` is a new component type, so no document that built before
  this change can carry either key. The explicit rejection exists so the
  message says *why*: to a caller of the handler, which gets the reason alone,
  and since go-kure/launcher#790 in a document too, where the authored-property
  check appends the reason to its refusal of the undeclared key.

  The six CronJobSpec-only keys — `schedule`, `timeZone`, `concurrencyPolicy`,
  `startingDeadlineSeconds`, `successfulJobsHistoryLimit` and
  `failedJobsHistoryLimit` — are rejected for the same reason `selector` is, but
  the case they guard is sharper. A `job` component and a `cronjob`
  component differ by exactly these six properties, so retyping an existing
  `cronjob` document to `job` leaves every one of them behind. Left undeclared
  each would be dropped in silence, turning a schedule into a Job that runs
  once, immediately, at apply time — not a missing field, but work executed at a
  time nobody asked for. Each message names the job-level property that does the
  nearest equivalent job where one exists (`activeDeadlineSeconds` for
  `startingDeadlineSeconds`, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` for both history limits),
  so the refusal is a redirection rather than only a "no".

  The properties this component introduces read an **explicit `null` as an
  omission**: `backoffLimitPerIndex: null` means "leave this unset", not "this is
  a value of the wrong type". That matches `pkg/oam`'s own
  `validatePropertyValue`. So does `completionMode`, which the shared
  `parseJobSpec` read with a bare lookup until go-kure/launcher#570, on
  `cronjob` as well. Since go-kure/launcher#394 this is not special to this component: every
  optional-field helper in `common.go` routes its presence check through
  `authoredValue`, so each JobSpec field shared with `cronjob` that is read
  through one of them reads a null the same way on both kinds, and so does a
  field any other kind reads through one. The change was
  one-directional — a null that used to be refused is now absence, and nothing
  that parsed before parses differently — so no document that built before
  stopped building.

  **The component name must be a DNS-1123 *label*, not merely a subdomain** — a
  rule this component shares with every workload kind; see "The main container
  is named after the component" under "Common config" above.

  **Updating a `job` in place needs it force-replaced, which the `force-replace`
  trait asks for.** A Job's pod
  template is immutable: `ValidateJobSpecUpdate` runs `validatePodTemplateUpdate`
  on every update, and the only carve-out is for scheduling directives on a
  suspended Job. By default, changing this component's `image`, `command`, `env`
  or any other pod-level property therefore produces an apply failure on the
  *second* delivery, not a re-run — the first apply creates the Job, and every
  later one is rejected while the Job object still exists. That default is
  deliberate and unchanged (go-kure/launcher#406): replacing a Job re-runs it, and
  for long batch work a re-run should be the author's explicit choice.

  To opt in, add the **`force-replace` trait** (no properties) to the component.
  It sets the `ForceReplace` delivery intent on the component's application
  (go-kure/launcher#782). kure's Flux workflow turns that into
  `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force: enabled` on every object the
  component emits — the Job — which kustomize-controller
  reads as its apply `ForceSelector`: on an immutable-field error it deletes and
  recreates the object, so an update re-runs the Job, **stopping any run in
  progress**. The workflow annotates the Job once it is generated,
  so the annotation is not lost when `createJob` clears the generated Job's annotations
  wholesale (`job.Annotations = nil` — a no-op since go-kure/launcher#361,
  because kure's `Create<Kind>` constructors now return TypeMeta and identity
  only; the assignment is kept so the field stays empty whatever a future
  constructor does). **Annotating the component itself still does not reach the
  Job**: a component's own annotations, the ones beside its `type` and
  `properties`, are read only for the tier annotation. The `annotations`
  property is another matter: it goes on the Job's own metadata, as on every
  kind component ("The object's labels and annotations" below). The Flux force
  annotation written there is on the Job as authored, and kustomize-controller
  reads it as it reads the workflow's; the trait is the way that names no
  delivery engine. See the
  [Trait Handlers](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam/builtin/traits)
  catalogue.

  Outside the package, `spec.force: true` on the enclosing Flux Kustomization
  has the same effect for every resource it reconciles, and deleting the Job
  before redelivering avoids the error without either. `cronjob` does not have
  this problem: a CronJob's `jobTemplate` is mutable, and each run creates a
  fresh Job.

  The generated `Job` carries `app: <component>` as its own labels and its pod
  template's, carries no annotations of the handler's, and leaves `spec.selector`
  unset for the job controller to fill. What the `labels` and `annotations`
  properties author is added to the Job's own metadata, not to its pod template.
  The empty selector is deliberate and is the one workload kind where it stays
  that way: the Job controller generates
  `spec.selector` plus its matching `controller-uid`/`job-name` pod labels
  server-side, so writing one here would fight it. Deployment, StatefulSet and
  DaemonSet get no such server-side defaulting and so are written explicitly —
  see Conventions.
- **helm** (go-kure/launcher#349, `helm.go`) — the role-named Helm component: a
  component-position lowering rule (`HelmRule`), not a handler, that lowers to the
  kind-named terminals. Properties: `chart`, `version`, `delivery`
  (`flux` default | `template`), `source` (inline `url` with optional `kind` and,
  for a GitRepository, `ref`; an inline Bucket's `kind`, `endpoint`, `bucketName`,
  `provider`, `region`, `prefix`; beside any of these a `name` for the generated
  source; or a reference `{name, kind, namespace}` to an
  existing HelmRepository, GitRepository, Bucket, OCIRepository or HelmChart),
  `values`, `valuesMode` (`inline` |
  `configMap`), `valuesConfigMapName`, `secretValues` (the sensitive part of the
  values tree, see below), `valuesSecretName`, `helmReleaseName` (the name of
  the HelmRelease object, see below),
  `scopeOverrides`, `hookGroupNamePrefix` and `layoutKustomizationName` (each under
  `delivery: template` only, see below),
  and the HelmRelease keys `interval`, `releaseName`,
  `targetNamespace`, `driftDetection`, `install`, `upgrade`, `valuesFrom`.
  - `delivery: flux` emits a `helmrelease` under the authored name, with the
    authored traits and annotations. A HelmRepository, GitRepository or Bucket
    source (go-kure/launcher#336) becomes `chart.spec.sourceRef` with `chart`
    required: the chart name, or for a GitRepository or Bucket the chart's path in
    the fetched artifact. For a GitRepository or Bucket the rule also sets
    `chart.spec.reconcileStrategy: Revision`, so a new source revision deploys even
    when the chart's version is unchanged (Flux's `ChartVersion` default would skip
    it); a HelmRepository keeps that default. An OCIRepository or HelmChart source
    becomes `chartRef`. `values` and the HelmRelease keys are forwarded verbatim, so their shape is
    the `helmrelease` terminal's to check. `valuesMode` is never forwarded, and the
    rule has no registration-time default for it: `inline` (or no `valuesMode`)
    keeps `values` on the `helmrelease`.
  - **`valuesMode: configMap`** (go-kure/launcher#702) with non-empty `values`
    moves them into a `configmap` trait the rule appends to the `helmrelease`, after
    its authored traits, and drops `values` from it. The trait's ConfigMap carries
    the values under the key `values.json`, and a `valuesFrom` entry
    `{kind: ConfigMap, name: <it>, valuesKey: values.json}` is placed before the
    authored entries, so an authored entry wins on a shared key (Flux merges
    `spec.valuesFrom` in list order). The values are serialized once, as indented JSON
    with sorted keys and numbers kept exact (JSON is YAML, which is how Flux reads a
    values reference); those exact bytes are both stored and hashed into the name:
    `<component>-values-<first 10 hex digits of their sha256>`. A name that would
    exceed 253 bytes is shortened by the one shortening rule
    (`oam.ShortenNameWithSuffix`, go-kure/launcher#793): the component name is cut to a
    prefix plus the first 10 hex digits of the sha256 of the full component name (8
    before go-kure/launcher#793, so such a name changes once), and the suffix is kept, so
    it is always a legal DNS-1123 subdomain and always carries the values hash. Identical values hash alike whatever their key order, and any change
    to them renames the ConfigMap and so changes the HelmRelease's spec, which is what
    makes Flux upgrade the release at once on a values-only edit (under this default
    name; see `valuesConfigMapName` below). Empty or absent `values`
    add no trait and no entry; `values` that are not a JSON object, a non-finite
    number in them, or a `valuesFrom` that is not a list are `helm:` build errors.
    Being an ordinary `configmap` trait, it is checked by that trait (a key it refuses,
    or data over the ConfigMap size limit, fails the build), labelled
    `app: <label value>` like the trait's other ConfigMaps, emitted after the
    HelmRelease, and moved with the release into the Flux namespace, since its
    `valuesFrom` names it. The trait builds its ConfigMap through the `configmap`
    kind's own code (go-kure/launcher#741); the values travel as one string, so the
    kind's string-only typing never refuses them. Known gap, shared with authored traits
    (go-kure/launcher#757): an authored `configmap` trait on the same component that
    takes the same name is not refused, and both ConfigMaps are emitted.
  - **`valuesConfigMapName` and `valuesSecretName`** (go-kure/launcher#787) name
    the values ConfigMap and the values Secret (`secretValues`, below). Each name
    is resolved in the one order of every generated name: the author's property,
    else the consumer's `Naming` hook (roles `values-configmap` and
    `values-secret`, asked with the component and the hashed default), else the
    default `<component>-values-<hash>` or `<component>-secret-values-<hash>`.
    A name from the author or the hook is used as written and gets no hash. It
    must be a DNS-1123 subdomain of at most 253 characters, and is refused
    otherwise, never shortened. Both objects follow the HelmRelease to the Flux
    namespace, so the name is held there against any other ConfigMap or Secret
    launcher names: one of the same name in the application namespace is another
    object.

    **The cost of a fixed name.** The default name moves with the content, so a
    values-only edit changes the HelmRelease's `spec.valuesFrom`, and Flux
    upgrades the release as soon as it sees the new HelmRelease. Under a name
    that does not move, the edit changes only the ConfigMap's or Secret's
    content, and the HelmRelease is unchanged. helm-controller still merges the
    referenced values on every reconciliation and upgrades the release when the
    result differs from the last one applied, so the edit is picked up at the
    release's next reconciliation: within its `interval`, not at once. Flux
    reconciles at once only where the ConfigMap or Secret carries the label
    `reconcile.fluxcd.io/watch: Enabled`, or helm-controller runs with a
    `--watch-configs-label-selector` that selects it. The rule sets no such
    label.

    A property that names nothing is refused: `valuesConfigMapName` without
    `valuesMode: configMap` or with empty `values`, `valuesSecretName` with
    empty or absent `secretValues`, and either under `delivery: template`, which
    generates neither object. Two components of one document cannot write the
    same name for the same kind: each generates its own object, and the second
    is refused (`helm: naming the values ConfigMap: name collision: ConfigMap
    "shared" is named by component "a" (role "values-configmap", set by
    valuesConfigMapName) and by component "b" (…); give one of them another
    name`).
  - **`helmReleaseName`** (go-kure/launcher#787) names the HelmRelease object,
    in the same order: the author's property, else the consumer's `Naming` hook
    (role `helm-release`, asked with the component), else the component name,
    so a document that does not set it and a hook that declines give the same
    output as before. A name that is not the default is used as written: a
    DNS-1123 subdomain of at most 253 characters, refused otherwise and never
    shortened. **`helmReleaseName` is the name of the HelmRelease object in the
    cluster (`metadata.name`); `releaseName` is the name Helm gives the release
    (`spec.releaseName`, the chart's `.Release.Name`).** Renaming the object
    moves nothing else: `spec.releaseName` stays the authored `releaseName` or
    the component name, so the installed release is not reinstalled under
    another name, the values ConfigMap and Secret keep their names, and the
    `helmrelease` member keeps the component's name, with its group, its
    placement and its traits. Nothing launcher writes names the HelmRelease, so
    no reference moves. The name is claimed where the HelmRelease lands, the
    default included: an authored `helmrelease` component whose `objectName` is
    the same name is refused in the transform with both named (`name collision:
    HelmRelease.helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io "default/chart" is named by component
    "chart" (role "helm-release", its default) and by component "rel" (role
    "object", set by properties.objectName); give one of them another name`).
    Under `delivery: template` the property is refused, since no HelmRelease is
    generated, and the hook is not asked.
  - **`secretValues`** (go-kure/launcher#786) is a second values tree, for the
    values that must not sit in the HelmRelease or in a ConfigMap. It is an object
    like `values`; absent, `null` or empty it changes nothing. The `helmrelease`
    kind has no such property: there, name a Secret in `valuesFrom`.
    - *Under `delivery: flux`* the rule appends a `secret` trait to the
      `helmrelease`, after its authored traits and after the values ConfigMap's
      trait. The trait's Secret holds the tree under the key `values.json`,
      serialized as the values ConfigMap's is, and is named
      `<component>-secret-values-<first 10 hex digits of the sha256 of those
      bytes>`, shortened past 253 bytes by the same rule
      (`oam.ShortenNameWithSuffix`). A `valuesFrom` entry
      `{kind: Secret, name: <it>, valuesKey: values.json}` is placed after the
      values ConfigMap's entry and before the authored entries, so the order is:
      values ConfigMap, values Secret, authored. No value of `secretValues` is
      written to the HelmRelease or to the values ConfigMap. Being an ordinary
      `secret` trait, it is checked by that trait (the 1 MiB limit), labelled
      `app: <label value>`, emitted after the HelmRelease, and moved with the
      release into the Flux namespace. A change in `secretValues` renames the
      Secret and so changes the HelmRelease, which is what makes Flux upgrade the
      release at once (under this default name; see `valuesSecretName` above).
    - *Under `delivery: template`* the tree is passed to the `helmtemplate`, which
      merges it over `values` for the render (see **helmtemplate**). Nothing is
      emitted for it: a value is in the output only where the chart renders it.
    - *A path set in both `values` and `secretValues` is refused*, under either
      delivery and either values mode:
      `helm: auth.password is set in both values and secretValues; a path may be
      set in only one of them`. Two objects at the same key are compared key by
      key; anything else at a key both trees set (a scalar, a list, a null, and
      a nil map a Go caller passes, which is a null) is a shared path. Under
      `delivery: template` the two trees are compared as they are, without a
      JSON round trip, since the render takes the values with their Go types:
      an object is a `map[string]any`, which is all a parsed document holds, and
      a map of another type a Go caller passes (`map[string]string`) at a key
      both trees set is a shared path too. An empty
      key is a key like any other and is written `""` in
      the message. Without the refusal the winner would depend on the values mode,
      since Flux applies inline `spec.values` after every `valuesFrom` entry.
    - *A key named `global` below the top level of `secretValues` is refused*,
      under either delivery and either values mode, before anything is rendered or
      emitted (go-kure/launcher#794, item 9):
      `helm: secretValues: redis.global: a key named global is allowed only at the
      top level, …`. Helm reads `<dependency>.global` as that dependency's globals.
      Where their shape conflicts with the chart's own `global` at a key, a table
      on one side and a plain value on the other, it drops the dependency's entry
      and prints it in a warning that cannot be intercepted: in the build's log
      under `delivery: template`, in the Flux controller's under `delivery: flux`.
      Launcher does not read the chart, so it cannot tell a dependency from any
      other key: a key named `global` below the top level that is not a
      dependency's globals cannot be given through `secretValues` either, only
      through `values`. Put a sensitive global under the top-level `global`, which
      every dependency receives and Helm does not print. The tree is searched as
      JSON, through objects only: a key in a list element is not refused. The
      message names the path by its keys and no value.
    - *Policy.* A policy that forbids explicit secrets
      (`oam.ExplicitSecretPolicy`, see the `pkg/oam` README) refuses a component
      with `secretValues`, under either delivery, with a violation naming the
      component. A policy that does not implement that optional interface allows
      it.
    - *No refusal of the property repeats a value.* It names `secretValues`, a
      path by its keys, or the type of a wrong value, and never wraps an encoding
      or decoding error, which could quote one. Under `delivery: template` an
      error about an object the chart rendered is another matter (see
      **helmtemplate**, "not covered").

    **Security note.** `secretValues` keeps sensitive values out of the
    HelmRelease and the values ConfigMap. It does not encrypt them. The generated
    Secret is in the build output in clear form (`data` is base64, an encoding):
    the output is exactly as sensitive as the input document, and so is every
    place it is written to, a Git repository or an OCI artifact included.
    Encrypting it is the consumer's business (SOPS or the like, on the written
    manifests). The Secret's name, and the HelmRelease naming it, carry 40 bits of
    a digest of the tree, so whoever reads either can test a guess of the whole
    tree against it. To keep a value out of the document and the output altogether,
    create the Secret out of band (an `external-secret` trait, a sealed or
    externally managed Secret) and name it in `valuesFrom`, or use the chart's own
    existing-secret values.
  - An inline source also emits the source: a `helmrepository` with only the URL
    for `http(s)://`, or an `ocirepository` with `ref.tag: <version>` for `oci://`.
    A Git repository needs `kind: GitRepository` set (an `http(s)://` URL alone
    means a Helm repository) and emits a `gitrepository` with the URL (`http://`
    or `https://`) and `source.ref`, which must set exactly one of
    `branch`, `tag`, `semver`, `name`, `commit`: Flux would otherwise check out
    branch `master`, or pick one of several fields by precedence. The schema
    publishes the rule as an `exclusive` group on `source.ref`, and a field
    authored as an empty string beside a set one counts as a second field.
    `kind: Bucket`
    with `endpoint` and `bucketName` (and optionally `provider`, `region`,
    `prefix`), and no `url`, emits a `bucket` with exactly those keys.
    Credentials (`secretRef` and the like) have no inline form: author the
    `gitrepository` or `bucket` component and reference it. That includes every
    `ssh://` repository, which Flux reads only with a key from `secretRef`.
    The `ocirepository` also selects the Helm chart content layer
    (`application/vnd.cncf.helm.chart.content.v1.tar+gzip`) with
    `operation: copy`. Flux therefore passes the chart archive through unchanged.
    By default it would extract and re-archive the chart, dropping files that its
    ignore rules exclude (`*.zip`, `*.png`, ...) even when the chart reads them
    with `.Files.Get`.
    It is named `<document>-source-<digest>`, where the 10-hex digest is taken
    over the content identity: `helm:<url>`, `oci:<url>:<version>`,
    `git:<JSON of url and ref>`, or `bucket:<JSON of provider, endpoint,
    bucketName, region, prefix>` (JSON, so a `:` inside a URL or endpoint cannot
    make two identities collide).
    Components of one document with the same identity share one source; the
    first emits it and the rest only reference it
    (`LoweringContext.ResolveSharedName`).
    Different documents never share or collide, because the document name is part
    of the source name. The source carries no traits and keeps its terminal's
    interval default rather than the release `interval`. The source terminal's
    registry allowlist (`ApplyPolicy`) applies to it.
  - **Naming the generated source** (go-kure/launcher#787). The name is
    resolved in the one order of every generated name: the author's
    `source.name`, else the consumer's `Naming` hook, else the default above.
    - *The hook* is asked under role `helm-source`, once for each source
      identity of a document, with the default `<document>-source-<digest>` and
      no component, since the source belongs to the document: every component of
      that identity that names no source adopts the answer.
    - *`source.name` beside an inline source* names the source that component
      generates. The name is the component's own choice. Components that write
      the same name for the same identity share one source; a component that
      writes none does not share it, and gets the document's source beside it
      (two sources of one identity), unless the name written is that source's
      own (its default, or the hook's answer): one name for one identity is one
      source. One name for two identities, or for two
      kinds, is refused as a collision naming both components, and so is a hook
      answer that gives two identities one name.
    - A name from the author or the hook is used as written: it must be a
      DNS-1123 subdomain of at most 253 characters and is refused otherwise,
      never shortened.
    - *The source cannot take the name of a component.* It is a component of the
      lowered document itself, so `source.name` equal to the component's own
      name, or to the name of another component the document holds, is refused
      (`helm: source.name "web" is the component's own name; the generated
      source is a component of the document too, so give it another name`). The
      default and a hook answer are held to the same rule (`helm: the generated
      source would be named "shop-source-…", the name of a helmrepository
      component of the document; … so rename that component, name the source
      with source.name, or have the Naming hook return another name for role
      "helm-source"`). To give a HelmRepository and its HelmRelease one name,
      author the `helmrepository` component with `objectName` and reference it.
    - The source lands beside the HelmRelease, in the Flux namespace when one is
      set. Its name is held there against every other object of its kind
      launcher names; an object of the same name and kind in the application
      namespace is another object.
    - `source.name` alone, with no inline source, references an existing source
      as before, and `source.namespace` belongs to that form only.

    **Breaking** (go-kure/launcher#787). A `helm` component with both
    `source.url` and `source.name` was refused and builds now, under
    `delivery: flux`. The refusal of `source.namespace` beside an inline source
    reads `helm: source.namespace is only valid with a reference to an existing
    source (source.name and no inline source); a generated source is created
    beside the HelmRelease`. An authored component that already has the name a
    generated source would take by default was refused by `pkg/oam` as a
    duplicate component name, and is now refused by the rule with the message
    above.
  - **The generated source is applied with the application bundle, ahead of
    every group** (go-kure/launcher#783). The rule orders the release after the
    source it generates or adopts (`Component.OrderAfter`), and `pkg/oam` puts
    such a source among the application bundle's own applications, beside the
    ordered groups. A source several releases share therefore exists once and
    precedes all of them, whatever tier a release is placed in. A `placement`
    policy or tier annotation naming the generated source, and a `dependency`
    rule making it wait on a component, fail the build. A source the component
    references by `source.name` is the author's own component and the rule
    orders nothing after it.
  - `delivery: template` emits a `helmtemplate` with the URL, its resolved kind,
    `chart`, `version`, `values`, `secretValues`, `scopeOverrides` and an authored `releaseName`,
    which the `helmtemplate` checks and, when unset, defaults to the component
    name, the release name the `delivery: flux` HelmRelease carries too
    (go-kure/launcher#785; see **helmrelease**). An authored `hookGroupNamePrefix`
    (go-kure/launcher#787) is passed on as written and is the `helmtemplate`'s; under
    `delivery: flux` it is refused with a `helm:` message, since a HelmRelease installs the
    chart, no hook-group layout exists and the prefix would name nothing. An authored
    `layoutKustomizationName` (go-kure/launcher#787) is passed on and refused the same way:
    under `delivery: flux` the component has no layout of its own. No source is emitted, and an authored
    `valuesMode: inline` is dropped. The rule refuses everything a client-side
    render cannot honour, each with a `helm:` message:
    - a source reference, and `valuesMode: configMap`;
    - `source.name` beside an inline source, `valuesConfigMapName`,
      `valuesSecretName` and `helmReleaseName` (go-kure/launcher#787): the render
      generates no source, no values ConfigMap, no values Secret and no
      HelmRelease, so each would name nothing;
    - an inline GitRepository or Bucket source, since the render fetches only
      from a Helm or OCI repository;
    - an OCI source without `version`;
    - every other HelmRelease key (`interval`, `targetNamespace`,
      `driftDetection`, `install`, `upgrade`, `valuesFrom`), which `helmtemplate`
      does not accept.
  - **`scopeOverrides`** (go-kure/launcher#794, item 11) states the scope of a kind
    the chart renders, for `delivery: template`: the list of `{apiVersion, kind,
    scope}` the `helmtemplate` and `manifests` components take, with the meaning it
    has there (see **Scope overrides** under **helmtemplate**). The rule forwards
    the authored list to the `helmtemplate` as written, under the declared spelling
    of the key, so a chart delivered through `helm` and one authored as a
    `helmtemplate` with the same list render the same objects. `null` reads as
    omission under either delivery.
    - *A malformed entry is refused by the rule*, with the shared parser's message
      under its own prefix (`helm: scopeOverrides[0]: scope "cluster" is invalid;
      must be "Cluster" or "Namespaced"`), so the message names the component type
      the author wrote. An entry that contradicts a `CustomResourceDefinition` the
      chart renders is refused when the chart is rendered, by the `helmtemplate`.
    - *`delivery: flux` refuses the property*, set or defaulted and whatever its
      shape: `helm: delivery: flux does not support scopeOverrides (only a
      client-side render reads it)`. Helm creates a HelmRelease's objects in the
      cluster, so nothing in the build could apply a stated scope, and dropping the
      property would let an author believe it took effect.
  - Strict, unlike the removed `helmchart` composite. An undeclared key at the top level or inside
    `source` is refused, and so are:
    - `delivery: native`;
    - `source.namespace` with an inline source;
    - an inline HelmRepository or OCIRepository URL carrying a user or password
      (`https://user:token@host`, `oci://user@registry/chart`), under either
      delivery: the URL is copied verbatim into the generated source or the
      render, so the credential would sit in plain text in the output.
      Credentials go in the `secretRef` of an authored `helmrepository` or
      `ocirepository`, referenced with `source.name`; a client-side render takes
      none. No message repeats the URL, not even the refusal of one that does
      not parse;
    - an inline GitRepository without exactly one `source.ref` field, or with a
      URL that is not `http://` or `https://` (an `ssh://` one needs credentials),
      or one that is more or less than a host, an optional port and a
      repository path (user info, a query or a fragment is refused), or whose
      port is outside 1–65535;
    - `url` with an inline Bucket, or one without `endpoint` or `bucketName`, or
      an `endpoint` that is more than a `host[:port]` or an `https://` URL of a
      host and port (user info, a path, a query, a fragment or `http://` is
      refused: a non-TLS endpoint needs `insecure: true`, which only an authored
      `bucket` takes) or whose port is outside 1–65535, or a `provider` other
      than `generic`, `aws`, `gcp` or `azure` (checked at the helm rule; the
      `bucket` terminal leaves it to the CRD);
    - `source.ref` other than on an inline GitRepository, and `endpoint`,
      `bucketName`, `provider`, `region`, `prefix` other than on an inline
      Bucket;
    - `chart` with an OCIRepository or HelmChart source;
    - `version` with a referenced OCIRepository or HelmChart source, which pins
      its own;
    - `version` with a GitRepository or Bucket source: Flux reads that chart at
      the source's fetched revision and ignores `version`;
    - two keys equal ignoring case, at the top level or inside `source`
      (`chart` and `Chart`): the decode would match both to one field and keep
      either.

  An authored component already named like a generated source fails the build:
  the rule refuses it when the document holds that component as the rule runs
  (see **Naming the generated source**), and `pkg/oam` refuses it as a duplicate
  component name when another rule emits it in the same lowering round.
- **helmchart** — since go-kure/launcher#351, the kind-named terminal for Flux's `HelmChart`:
  see **helmrepository / ocirepository / gitrepository / bucket / helmchart**. Until
  go-kure/launcher#350 the name belonged to a role-level composite (a HelmRelease plus its source,
  or a client-side render), which is gone; use `helm`. A document written for the composite
  fails validation on a key `HelmChartSpec` does not declare. When that key is one of the
  composite's own that `HelmChartSpec` lacks (`delivery`, `releaseName`, `targetNamespace`,
  `source`, `values`, `valuesMode`, `driftDetection`, `install`, `upgrade`, `valuesFrom`), the
  error adds a pointer to `helm`; any other unknown key gets the plain error. To
  migrate, change `type: helmchart` to `type: helm` and rename `delivery: native` to
  `delivery: flux`; the other properties keep their names. The output then changes only as
  this table says. `TestHelmParity` (`pkg/cmd/kurel`) pins it on three fixture pairs: the
  last `helmchart` output of each input, frozen before the removal, is diffed against the
  `helm` build, and the diffs are in `pkg/cmd/kurel/testdata/helm-parity/`:

  | # | What changes with `helm` |
  |---|---|
  | 1 | The values ConfigMap name carries a values hash. |
  | 2 | A generated source is named `<app>-source-<digest>`, not after the component. |
  | 3 | *(void)* `oci` and Helm-over-OCI components: neither shares an OCIRepository with the other (go-kure/launcher#665). |
  | 4 | The delivery value `native` is `flux`. |
  | 5 | *(void)* `targetNamespace` under a Flux namespace: both default it to the application namespace (go-kure/launcher#625). |
  | 6 | A generated source keeps its terminal's default interval, not the release interval. |
  | 7 | No registration-time `valuesMode` default; `valuesMode` is never forwarded (under `configMap` the values become a `configmap` trait). |
  | 8 | *(void)* Generated sources: neither gets an automatic health check; launcher sets none (go-kure/launcher#781). |
  | 9 | The registry allowlist applies to inline sources. |
  | 10 | Generated sources are applied with the application bundle, ahead of every group. A tier annotation on the component places only its release. |
  | 11 | Template delivery refuses `targetNamespace`, and an unset `releaseName` renders under the component name, shortened as Flux shortens a release name, instead of `release` (go-kure/launcher#776, go-kure/launcher#785). |
  | 12 | `chart` is refused with an OCIRepository or HelmChart source. |
  | 13 | `version` is refused with a referenced OCIRepository or HelmChart source. |
  | 14 | `source.namespace` is refused together with `url`. |
  | 15 | Unknown keys are refused at any depth of `source`, and so are two keys that differ only in case. |
  | 16 | *(void)* A generated OCIRepository: both set `layerSelector` (the chart content layer, `copy`) (go-kure/launcher#665). |
  | 17 | `placement` may not place a generated source in any tier, and a `dependency` rule may not make it wait. |
  | 18 | Any other `helmchart` default or build-time check a terminal does not reproduce (strict decoding). |
  | 19 | The HelmRelease carries the component label and a post-renderer that sets it on the chart's pod templates, as every component's output does (go-kure/launcher#788). |
  | 20 | Every HelmRelease carries `spec.releaseName`: the authored value, else the component name, where `helmchart` left an unset one to Flux (go-kure/launcher#785). |

  Two `helmchart` behaviours have no `helm` counterpart beyond row 18: `valuesMode: configMap`
  no longer makes the component a `LayoutAugmenter` (the values ConfigMap comes from a
  `configmap` trait on the `helmrelease`, ordinary build output, so `kurel build` accepts it and a layout-walking consumer
  no longer moves the component into a sub-layout), and under `delivery: template` the render's
  `.Release.Namespace` can no longer be authored (row 11; see **helmtemplate**).
- **helmrelease** — the kind-named terminal for Flux's `HelmRelease`
  (go-kure/launcher#327, part of the Helm-family redesign go-kure/launcher#336). Its
  properties are exactly the top-level JSON keys of `HelmReleaseSpec` in the
  helm-controller API version `go.mod` links; a test ties the published schema to that struct, so a helm-controller bump that adds or
  drops a spec field fails the suite until the schema follows. It creates no source:
  `chart.spec.sourceRef` or `chartRef` names one that already exists.

  **Decoding.** The whole property map is decoded with `builtin.DecodeStrictJSON` into
  `HelmReleaseSpec`. A key the struct does not declare,
  at any depth (`chart.spec.chartVersion`, a stray key inside a `valuesFrom` entry), is refused
  by name, and so is a wrongly typed value (`suspend: "yes"`, `maxHistory: "3"`, an
  unparsable duration). The schema keeps the nested Flux blocks as open objects; the strict
  decode is what checks them. `valuesMode` is refused like any other unknown key; the
  error adds a pointer to the `helm` component's `valuesMode: configMap`, or a
  `configmap` trait plus a `valuesFrom` entry, which replace it (go-kure/launcher#702).
  Known gap, inherited from the decoder:
  inside a type with its own `UnmarshalJSON` unknown keys are not refused — `values` is the
  case that matters, and it is open by design. Keys match case-insensitively, as in
  `encoding/json`; schema validation, which a `kurel build` runs first, is exact.

  **Defaults and checks.** `interval` defaults to `60m` when unset (a zero duration counts
  as unset); Flux requires the field. A set `interval` must be a duration Flux accepts
  (go-kure/launcher#590, go-kure/launcher#601; `oci` applies the same check). The CRDs
  require `^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ms|s|m|h))+$`: unsigned, in `ms`, `s`, `m` or `h` (`10m`,
  `1h30m`, `1.5h`). `time.ParseDuration` alone would also accept `-5m` or `500us`, which
  would fail at apply time; both are build errors. The value is emitted as a
  `metav1.Duration`, which serializes `Duration.String()` rather than the authored text, so
  that form is checked too: `0.5ms` matches the pattern but is written as `500µs`, and is
  refused as below Flux's millisecond resolution. A positive value too small for the
  duration type (`0.0000000001ms`) is refused the same way rather than emitted as `0s`. In
  practice any value of `0s` or at least `1ms` is accepted. The check runs on the authored
  text, which also refuses a positive value that would decode to zero and be replaced by the
  default, and again in `Generate` on the decoded duration's emitted form, for a config built
  directly. It lives in the internal `pkg/oam/internal/fluxduration`. Its other
  duration fields are checked
  the same way, in the same form (go-kure/launcher#606): `timeout`, `chart.spec.interval`,
  `install.timeout`, `upgrade.timeout`, `test.timeout`, `rollback.timeout`,
  `uninstall.timeout`, and `install.strategy.retryInterval` and
  `upgrade.strategy.retryInterval`. A nested key matches case-insensitively at every level, as
  the decode does. Exactly one of
  `chart` and `chartRef` is required. The published schema lists both as optional and says
  so in the handler's `exclusive` group (go-kure/launcher#790): a validator built from it
  refuses both and neither, as the build does. Under an authored `chart`, `chart.spec.sourceRef.kind`
  is required (go-kure/launcher#790): the API requires it and takes `HelmRepository`,
  `GitRepository` or `Bucket`, the Go type leaves an empty one out of the object, and the
  kind does not choose a source's kind for the author, so a reference without one is
  refused with `chart.spec.sourceRef.kind: required (…)`. Which of the three it is stays the
  CRD's to check. An authored `chart.spec.verify` that names no `provider` is written with
  `provider: cosign`, the API's default: the Go type writes the field whether or not it was
  authored, so the API's default never applies, and the object is then what the API would
  have made of the omitted field. An authored `provider: ""` is refused, since the type
  cannot tell it from an unauthored one and the API's enum (`cosign`, `notation`) refuses it
  as written. Two spellings of one key on the way (`Provider` and `provider`) are refused,
  since the decode keeps one value and drops the other. `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` holds both to the
  markers in the source of the linked Flux modules, which ship no CRD: the required field
  to a refusal shown on a document, and the written value to the default the marker states,
  so an upstream change of that default fails the test. "Required" there is what the
  markers say; no API server was asked. `values` must be a JSON object; a non-finite number
  (`.nan`, `.inf`) is a build error, never a panic. Each `valuesFrom` entry is held to the
  `ValuesReference` CRD's own constraints, and a violation is a build error naming the
  entry's index: `kind` is `Secret` or `ConfigMap`, exactly as Flux's enum spells them
  (go-kure/launcher#748); `name` is required and at most 253 characters; a set `valuesKey`
  is at most 253 characters and matches `^[\-._a-zA-Z0-9]+$`; a set `targetPath` is at
  most 250 characters and matches the CRD's pattern (dot-path characters, `\`, `/`, and
  `[n]` indexes of up to five digits) (go-kure/launcher#762). Lengths count characters, as
  the CRD's `maxLength` does, not bytes. Like the other checks these run again in
  `Generate`, and they cover the `valuesFrom` a `helm` component passes through. Nothing
  else is checked here: the enum checks on `driftDetection.mode`, `install.crds` and
  `upgrade.crds` are left to the HelmRelease CRD's own admission, and so are the limits of
  an authored `releaseName`.

  **Release name** (go-kure/launcher#785). A component that authors no `releaseName` gets
  `spec.releaseName` set to the component name, so every HelmRelease in the output names its
  release. A name over 53 characters, Helm's limit, is shortened as Flux helm-controller
  shortens a release name — its first 40 characters, `-`, and the first 12 hex digits of the
  SHA-256 of the whole name (`oam.ShortenName` at `oam.ShortenLimitHelmRelease`,
  go-kure/launcher#793) — so the written name is the one Flux would shorten the component
  name to itself. An authored `releaseName` is written as it is, never shortened.
  `helmtemplate` renders under the same default, so a `helm` component releases its chart
  under one name with `delivery: flux`, with or without a Flux namespace, and with
  `delivery: template`. A default Helm would not install under is a build error with the
  remedy to set `releaseName`: the shortening can cut a dotted name just after a `.`, leaving
  a label that starts with `-`. The check runs again in `Generate`, where a
  `HelmReleaseConfig` built directly with neither a `Name` nor a `releaseName` is refused as
  well: it has nothing to derive a default from.

  **Breaking output change** (go-kure/launcher#785): every HelmRelease gains
  `spec.releaseName`. Left unset, Flux names a release `<targetNamespace>-<name>` when
  `spec.targetNamespace` is set and `<name>` otherwise, so the release name itself changes
  wherever a target namespace is set and no `releaseName` is authored: under a Flux
  namespace, which defaults one (below), and with an authored `targetNamespace` alone. There
  the release `shop-web` of a component `web` with target namespace `shop` becomes `web`. Flux
  does not rename a release that is already installed: it uninstalls the existing release and
  installs a new one under the new name (the warning on `.spec.releaseName` in Flux's
  HelmRelease reference). To keep the installed release, author its name as `releaseName` on
  such a component: `<targetNamespace>-<name>`, or, where that is over 53 characters, the
  shortened name Flux installed it under (its first 40 characters, `-`, 12 hex digits of its
  SHA-256; the `name` of an entry in the HelmRelease's `status.history`). The long form is
  not accepted there: the HelmRelease CRD limits `releaseName` to 53 characters. Without a
  target namespace the name stays `<name>` and only the field is new.

  **Identity and namespaces.** The HelmRelease is named after the component and lands in
  the Flux namespace when one is configured, else in the application namespace
  (`SetFluxNamespace`). Under a Flux namespace, a component that does not author
  `targetNamespace` gets `spec.targetNamespace` set to the application namespace, so the
  release still installs there rather than into the Flux namespace; an authored value wins.
  The Kustomization `oci` emits has no such default, deliberately (go-kure/launcher#794,
  item 1): a HelmRelease's `targetNamespace` only says where the release installs, while a
  Kustomization's overrides the namespace of every namespaced object in the artifact (see
  `oci`).
  The ConfigMaps and Secrets the HelmRelease reads from its own namespace — `valuesFrom`,
  `kubeConfig.secretRef` / `configMapRef`, and `chart.spec.verify.secretRef` when
  helm-controller creates the HelmChart beside the release (`chart.spec.sourceRef` names no
  namespace, or names the Flux namespace) — must live in the Flux namespace too. A `configmap`, `external-secret` or `certificate` trait on the
  component whose object one of them names moves there with the release; one none of them names
  stays in the application namespace with the release's workloads (go-kure/launcher#740). A
  trait ConfigMap named in `valuesFrom` therefore leaves the application namespace even when the
  chart's pods read it too; give the pods their own copy, under another name, if they need it.
  The target namespace does not reach the release name: `spec.releaseName` is always set
  (see **Release name**), so Flux does not derive `<targetNamespace>-<name>`. Author
  `releaseName` when a specific release name matters — for instance when taking over a
  release installed under another name. Helm keeps its release state in the HelmRelease's
  own namespace unless `storageNamespace` says otherwise (Flux's default).

  **Values in a ConfigMap.** The HelmRelease is the only object `helmrelease` emits.
  Until go-kure/launcher#702 it took a launcher-owned `valuesMode: configMap` and emitted
  the values ConfigMap itself; that key is gone (see **Decoding**). The `helm`
  component's `valuesMode: configMap` produces the same ConfigMap through a `configmap`
  trait (see **helm**), and on a `helmrelease` authored directly the same result is a
  `configmap` trait plus a `valuesFrom` entry naming it.
- **helmtemplate** — the kind-named terminal for a client-side Helm render
  (go-kure/launcher#348, part of the Helm-family redesign go-kure/launcher#336), and what the
  role-named `helm` rule lowers to under `delivery: template`.
  It fetches and renders the chart at build time and emits the rendered manifests, each checked
  against the environment policy (see **Policy** below). It creates no source CR and no
  `HelmRelease`.

  **Properties.** `source` is
  required: `url` (required) is an `http://` or `https://` Helm repository URL, or an `oci://`
  URL naming the chart; `kind` (optional, `HelmRepository` or `OCIRepository`) is inferred from
  the scheme when unset — `oci://` is `OCIRepository`, anything else `HelmRepository` — and
  must agree with it when set. A `url` carrying a user or password is refused, since the render
  takes no credentials, and the message never repeats it. `chart` is required for a
  `HelmRepository`; an `OCIRepository`'s URL already names the chart, so there `chart` is not
  used. `version`
  is required for an `OCIRepository`. `values` is an open object, the Helm values tree, and must
  be representable as JSON: a non-finite number (`.nan`, `.inf`) is a build error. The source
  checks are shared with the `helm` rule's inline source rather than copied. `scopeOverrides`
  states the scope of a kind the chart renders (see **Scope overrides** below).
  `hookGroupNamePrefix` (go-kure/launcher#787) is the prefix of the names of the hook-group
  layouts, in place of `<application>-<component>`, and so of their Flux Kustomizations under
  `FluxIntegratedPerLayout`; so does a prefix the `Naming` hook returns for the `hook-group`
  role. With neither, the default prefix names only the layouts: kure names each Kustomization
  `<unit>-<layout name>` (go-kure/launcher#941). See the hook-group paragraph below.
  `layoutKustomizationName` (go-kure/launcher#787) is the name of the Flux Kustomization of
  the component's own layout, in place of `<bundle>-<component>`; see the same paragraph.

  `secretValues` (go-kure/launcher#786) is a second open object, for the sensitive part of the
  values tree; it is what the `helm` rule forwards its own `secretValues` as. The chart is
  rendered with `secretValues` merged over `values`, object by object, with the authored value
  types. The terminal emits nothing for it, so a value is in the output only where the chart
  renders it: a chart that puts it in a Secret emits that Secret in clear form, and one that
  puts it in a ConfigMap or an environment variable emits it there. The output is as sensitive
  as the input; see the security note under **helm**. Further:
  - a path set in both trees is refused, naming the path
    (`helmtemplate: auth.password is set in both values and secretValues; …`), by the rule the
    `helm` component states;
  - a key named `global` below the top level is refused, naming the path, before any fetch
    (`helmtemplate: secretValues: redis.global: a key named global is allowed only at the top
    level, …`), by the rule the `helm` component states and with its trade-off: such a key that
    is not a dependency's globals can be given through `values` only, and a sensitive global
    goes under the top-level `global`;
  - a policy that forbids explicit secrets (`oam.ExplicitSecretPolicy`) refuses the component
    in `ApplyPolicy`, before any fetch
    (`helmtemplate: secretValues is set and the environment policy forbids explicit secrets; …`).
    **Not covered:** a Secret the chart itself renders. It is emitted under such a policy, where
    the `passthrough` and `manifests` components refuse a Secret they carry: its content comes
    from the chart and its values, and most charts render one;
  - a render or decode failure is not reported as Helm reports it, since a template error can
    quote a value (`fail`, `required`, a YAML parse error showing the line). The chart is
    rendered a second time with `values` alone. If that fails too, its error is the one
    reported, after `rendering chart with secretValues failed; the cause is withheld because it
    can repeat a sensitive value. Without them it fails with: …`. If it succeeds, the message is
    only `rendering chart with secretValues failed, and without them it renders; the cause is
    withheld because it can repeat a sensitive value`. To debug such a chart, render it
    with placeholder values in `values`. The second render repeats the fetch;
  - *not covered:* an error about a rendered object. No check that runs on what the chart
    rendered, once it has decoded, scrubs its error. It names the object it refuses by kind
    and name, and can quote any part of the object it refuses or locates the refusal by. The
    policy checks (see **Policy**) quote a container's or a volume's name, an image reference,
    a resource quantity, a capability; the transform's component label quotes the key of a
    label that is not a string. So any part of a rendered object can reach an error: a chart
    that builds one from a sensitive value has it quoted there. The refusal of a field the kind's type does not
    declare is not among them: it is a decode failure, withheld as above. The refusal of a
    `scopeOverrides` entry that contradicts a CustomResourceDefinition the chart renders (see
    **Scope overrides** below) is such an error and is not withheld: it names the kind, the
    object's name and the two scopes, never a value;
  - Helm's own warnings about a values conflict quote the value Helm drops. With the refusal
    above that is never a value of `secretValues`: for a top-level `global` it is the
    dependency's `global` entry from `values`, and for a dependency's ordinary key it is the
    dependency's default. A test pins both, each way round, on the process's standard log and
    its default `slog` logger.

  **Release name.** `releaseName` is the render's `.Release.Name`. Unset, it is the default the
  `helmrelease` terminal writes to `spec.releaseName` (go-kure/launcher#785): the component
  name, and for a name over 53 characters, Flux helm-controller's shortened form of it — its
  first 40 characters, `-`, and the first 12 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the whole name. A
  `helm` component therefore renders under `delivery: template` with the same release name its
  HelmRelease is installed under with `delivery: flux`, whatever its target namespace. The chart
  and its source play no part. The name, authored or defaulted, must be a valid Helm release name
  by Helm's own rule — a DNS-1123 subdomain of at most 53 characters — since kure's render checks
  nothing. An authored name is never shortened: one over 53 characters is refused. A default that
  is not valid — the shortening can cut a dotted name just after a `.`, leaving a label that starts
  with `-` — is refused with the remedy to set `releaseName`, as Flux would fail to install it. A
  `HelmTemplateConfig` built directly defaults it from `Name` the same way, and is refused when
  both are empty. Since component names are unique in a document, two renders of one chart no
  longer share a release name by default. Two given the same `releaseName` in one namespace
  generate the same objects when the chart names its objects after the release, as most do, and
  `kurel build` refuses them as a generated-object collision rather than merging them. Before
  go-kure/launcher#776 every render used kure's default `release`; the project is pre-GA, so the
  changed object names of an existing template-rendered chart carry no compatibility shim.

  **Decoding.** `values`, `secretValues` and `scopeOverrides` are split off, and the rest of the property map is decoded with
  `builtin.DecodeStrictJSON` into a closed struct, so any other key, at any depth, is refused by
  name, as is a wrongly typed value. `values` itself reaches the render exactly as authored, with
  its YAML-decoded value types, rather than the strict decoder's `json.Number` re-reading, which
  a chart template comparing a value with a number would treat differently; `secretValues` likewise.
  A `secretValues` that is not an object is refused by its type, never by its content. The schema declares
  the same keys, with `source` closed to `url` and `kind`, and a test ties it to the struct. Keys
  match case-insensitively in the handler, as in `encoding/json`; schema validation, which a
  `kurel build` runs first, is exact.

  **Refused outright.** `targetNamespace`, every property only a Flux-reconciled release reads
  (`interval`, `driftDetection`, `install`, `upgrade`, `valuesFrom`, `valuesMode`), the `helm`
  rule's `delivery` switch, and a source reference (`source.name`, `source.namespace`) are
  undeclared keys: schema validation refuses each, and so does the strict decode. An
  `OCIRepository` source without `version` is refused by the handler. The key itself is what is
  refused, whatever it holds. The render's `.Release.Namespace` is the application namespace;
  the terminal declares no `targetNamespace`, so it cannot be set.

  **Namespace.** A namespaced rendered object that carries no `metadata.namespace` is given the
  application namespace, where a Helm install into that namespace would create it
  (go-kure/launcher#794, item 4). Each object's scope is resolved as the `manifests` component
  resolves it, by the one function both call (`resolveObjectScope`, `manifests.go`): a
  `scopeOverrides` entry for the object's kind, else kure's scope table (`manifest.Scope`) — the
  kinds kure registers, in any API version — plus the scope a `CustomResourceDefinition` among
  the emitted objects declares for the kind it defines. Unlike `manifests`, the render refuses
  nothing about what the chart wrote, since the application does not author a chart:
  - a namespace the chart wrote is kept, on a cluster-scoped object too, as Helm keeps it;
  - a cluster-scoped object without one stays without;
  - an object of unknown scope without one is left as rendered, with no namespace and no error:
    a kind kure does not register — a custom resource, or a built-in of an API group kure's
    scheme does not hold — with no CRD for it among the emitted objects and no `scopeOverrides`
    entry. `Lease`, `EndpointSlice` and the image-reflector kinds (`ImageRepository`,
    `ImagePolicy`) are registered, so one without a namespace is given the application
    namespace. Whoever applies the output decides where it lands (Flux's `targetNamespace`, a
    client's default namespace). A chart's `crds/` directory is not rendered, and a CRD under a
    dropped hook is not emitted, so neither gives a kind a scope.

  The policy check runs on the stamped objects, so a violation names an object with the
  namespace it is emitted in. A `HelmTemplateConfig` built directly with an empty `Namespace`
  has none to give and stamps nothing.

  **Scope overrides** (go-kure/launcher#794, item 11). `scopeOverrides` states the scope of a
  kind the chart renders, for a kind of unknown scope above: a list of `{apiVersion, kind,
  scope}`, `scope` being `Cluster` or `Namespaced`, matched on the exact `apiVersion` and
  `kind`. It is the property `manifests` has, read by the same parser (`parseScopeOverrides`)
  and resolved by the same function, so an entry means the same on both: it outranks kure's
  own table, is ignored for a kind the Kubernetes API itself scopes, and must agree with a
  `CustomResourceDefinition` among the emitted objects (see **crd / manifests**). A test holds
  the two components to the same answer for the same objects and overrides.
  - `Namespaced`: an object of the kind without `metadata.namespace` is given the application
    namespace, as a kind kure knows to be namespaced is.
  - `Cluster`: an object of the kind is left as rendered. That includes one the chart wrote a
    namespace on, which `manifests` refuses: template delivery refuses nothing about what a
    chart wrote.
  - An entry for a kind the chart does not render does nothing. `null` reads as omission.

  *Refused*, two cases only. A malformed entry, at decode and before any render, with the
  `manifests` messages under this component's prefix (`helmtemplate: scopeOverrides[0]: scope
  "cluster" is invalid; must be "Cluster" or "Namespaced"`). And an entry that contradicts a
  `CustomResourceDefinition` the chart renders for the kind, when the chart is rendered
  (`helmtemplate "<component>": object Widget "w": scopeOverrides says Cluster but the
  CustomResourceDefinition for Widget.fixtures.example.com the chart renders declares
  Namespaced; …`): that CRD defines the scope the cluster will serve, so no cluster can honour
  the entry. The message names the object's kind and name and the two scopes, nothing else of
  the object. A `HelmTemplateConfig` built directly holds the overrides in `ScopeOverrides`,
  where a value other than the two scopes is refused before the render.

  The `helm` rule takes the same property under `delivery: template` and forwards it here as
  written, after refusing a malformed entry under its own prefix; under `delivery: flux` it
  refuses the property (see **helm**).

  *Not covered:* no policy or placement check on template output reads an object's scope, so
  the overrides change the namespace stamp and nothing else.
  Not breaking: a document that does not use the property renders as before.

  **Breaking output change** (go-kure/launcher#794): such objects gain `metadata.namespace` in
  the output. Before, a chart that left it unset rendered namespace-less objects, which landed
  wherever the applying client defaulted them.

  **Breaking output change** (go-kure/launcher#790, with the kure version that registers
  them): `Lease`, `EndpointSlice`, `PriorityClass`, `RuntimeClass`, `APIService`, the
  `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1` kinds and the image-reflector kinds are read as their
  Go types, no longer as kinds the build does not know. One that sets only fields its type
  declares is emitted from that type; one that sets a field the type does not declare is
  emitted as rendered, the field kept (*Undeclared fields*, below); a field of the wrong type
  is now a build error. The namespaced ones (`Lease`, `EndpointSlice`, `ImageRepository`,
  `ImagePolicy`) gain `metadata.namespace` when the chart left it unset. A chart that renders
  a `v1` `List` or a typed list now builds, and each of its items is held to the policy and
  to *Undeclared fields* as a document of its own is. A list of a kind the scheme does not
  register no longer builds when a `helm.sh/hook` annotation is involved, on the list or on
  an item (see "Rendered objects"): it built before, with a wrong output, the list's hook
  lost and its items emitted as ordinary resources.

  **Breaking** (go-kure/launcher#790, with the kure version that reads a list in one place,
  go-kure/kure#1014), for template delivery, `manifests` and `crd` alike. Built before,
  refused now:

  | Document | Before | Now |
  |---|---|---|
  | A list (a `v1` `List`, a typed list, a list of an unregistered kind) with a label or an annotation on its own metadata | Built: the items emitted, the list's metadata dropped. Template delivery refused only `helm.sh/hook` there, and still does, with its own text | `List has metadata of its own that its items cannot keep: annotations …; labels …` |
  | `Kind` or `apiversion` beside the exact key, on a document or on an item of a list | Built, with two exceptions: emitted as written, the extra key kept. A workload or a claim was refused already, by *Undeclared fields* (`undeclared field Kind`), and so was an item of a typed list whose `Kind` or `apiversion` states another value than the list holds, by the parser (`the item states …, the list holds …`). Both are refused now with the other text | `the key "Kind" equals "kind" only after case folding; write it "kind" or remove it` |
  | `Items` on a `v1` `List` | Decoded, to no object at all: a chart or a source with other objects built. A `manifests` or `crd` source that held nothing else was refused already (`source resolved to no manifests`) | The same text, for `"Items"` |
  | `Items` on a list of an unregistered kind | Built: the list emitted as one object | The same text |
  | A `null` item in a list of an unregistered kind | Built: an otherwise empty object emitted, with the list's `apiVersion` and its kind without `List` | `item 0 of WidgetList: the item is null, not an object` |
  | An item of a registered kind, in a list of an unregistered kind, that does not decode as its type (`data: 1` on a ConfigMap) | Built: the item emitted as written. A workload, a claim or a PersistentVolume there did not build: the policy check refused it as unreadable, and it is refused now for the decode | The item's decode error, naming its position |
  | In a JSON document, an item of a registered kind, in a list of an unregistered kind, that states `apiVersion` or `kind` and then `null` for it, where the stated value is not the one its list gives it | Built: the item emitted as written. A workload, a claim or a PersistentVolume there did not build: the policy check refused it as unreadable | `item 0 of FooList: Deployment "web": the object was read as apps/v1 Deployment, and the decode that checks its fields reads the document as example.com/v1 Deployment, so its fields cannot be checked; …` (*Undeclared fields*, below) |
  | An object of an unregistered kind that does not end in `List`, with a top-level `items` array | Built: the entries emitted in its place, each unstructured | `… an `items` array on an object of a kind that is no list (example.com/v1 Widget) is read as a list by what applies the output …` |

  Not refusals, and a change of output all the same: an item of a registered kind in a list of
  an unregistered kind is read as its Go type, as in a `v1` `List`, where it was emitted as
  written. It is emitted from that type, *Undeclared fields* applies to it, and the policy
  check reads it: a workload, a claim or a PersistentVolume there was refused as unreadable
  and is now checked, and builds when the policy allows it. A list inside such a list was
  left whole, and refused by the policy check; it is opened in turn.

  Texts that changed: a `null` item of a `v1` `List` was `nil runtime object provided` and is
  `the item is null, not an object`; `… is nested more than 8 lists deep` now holds for a
  list of an unregistered kind too; the policy check's refusal of an object with a top-level
  `items` array no longer says the object `sits inside a list of an unregistered kind`, and
  no decode returns such an object any more (*Limits*, below).

  **Output order.** Every rendered manifest carrying a `helm.sh/hook` annotation (or a standalone
  `helm.sh/hook-weight`) is grouped by `(phase, weight)` via kure's `helm.SplitByHookWeight`.
  `Generate` returns every rendered object flat, in hook-execution order —
  `pre-install, pre-upgrade, main, post-install, post-upgrade, <unknown, alphabetical>` — with a
  multi-event annotation such as `pre-install,pre-upgrade` placed by its earliest phase; a chart
  with no hook annotations at all yields one group, in chart-render order.
  `pre-delete`/`post-delete`/`pre-rollback`/`post-rollback`/`test` objects are dropped outright
  (kure does not surface them as static manifests) — mostly a bug fix, since a `test` Pod rendered
  as a static GitOps object would otherwise be reconciled on every apply, but it is silent data
  loss for a chart that relies on one of those hooks; `pkg/oam` has no logging channel to flag it.

  **Rendered objects.** The render is decoded with kure's manifest parser
  (`io.ParseYAMLWithOptions`, unstructured allowed), the decode the `manifests` component uses
  (go-kure/launcher#791). An object of a kind kure's scheme registers is emitted as its Go type —
  a Deployment as `*appsv1.Deployment`, a hook Job as `*batchv1.Job` — and any other as
  unstructured. What follows from reading a document as the API server does:
  - a field the registered type does not declare is not dropped, as the parser alone would drop
    it: the object is refused or emitted as rendered (*Undeclared fields*, below). A value of
    the wrong type (an unquoted `true` as an annotation value) is a build error;
  - YAML is read as YAML 1.1, so an unquoted `yes` or `y` is a boolean; a mapping key that is not
    a string (`1:`) becomes its string form, and an unquoted timestamp stays the string the chart
    wrote; in an unstructured object an integer an int64 cannot hold becomes a float;
  - a large integer survives the write where the object holds it as an integer. Since
    go-kure/kure#1006 kure's manifest writer writes an integer field of a typed object, and an
    integer in an unstructured one, with its own digits: `9007199254740993` and
    `9223372036854775807` are written as rendered (they were written `9007199254740992` and
    `9223372036854776000`). That holds for every object launcher writes, whichever component
    emitted it. A number the object holds as a float is written as that float, with the
    shortest digits that read back as it, and an integer an int64 cannot hold is such a float
    in an unstructured object (the item above): `9223372036854775808` is written
    `9223372036854776000`, and `18446744073709551615` as `1.8446744073709552e+19`. A value
    that large has to be a string in a field that takes one;
  - an empty, null or comment-only document is skipped, while a scalar, a sequence, `{}` and a
    mapping without `apiVersion` and `kind` are build errors — in a document
    of a dropped hook as well, since the render is decoded before hooks are grouped;
  - a list document is replaced by its items, in the list's order. What a list is, is kure's
    parser's to say, in one place since go-kure/kure#1014: a list kind the scheme registers
    (a `v1` `List`, a typed list such as `DeploymentList`), and a kind the scheme does not
    register whose name ends in `List` and that states `items`. Each item of a typed list is
    decoded as the kind the list holds. Each item of a `v1` `List` and of a list of an
    unregistered kind is decoded as a document of its own: typed when its kind is registered,
    unstructured otherwise, and a list among them is replaced by its items in turn, to the
    eight levels the parser bounds. An item of a list of an unregistered kind that leaves
    `apiVersion` or `kind` out is read with the list's `apiVersion` and the list's kind
    without `List`. An item that does not decode, or is `null`, is a build error naming its
    position (`item 0 of WidgetList: the item is null, not an object`). A list is never
    emitted, so what it states on its own metadata would be lost: a label or an annotation
    there is the parser's error (`List has metadata of its own that its items cannot keep:
    annotations helm.sh/resource-policy`). A kind the scheme does not register that ends in
    `List` and states no `items` is one object; a registered list kind that states none is a
    list without items, and yields no object;
  - `apiVersion`, `kind` and, on a list, `items` are read under those exact keys, and a key
    that equals one of them only after case folding (`Kind`, `apiversion`, `Items`) is the
    parser's error, on a document and on an item of a list (`the key "Kind" equals "kind" only
    after case folding; write it "kind" or remove it`): the readers of a document downstream
    do not agree on which of two such keys stands;
  - an object of a kind the scheme does not register and that does not end in `List`, with a
    top-level `items` array (`{kind: Widget, items: [...]}`), is a build error, with a policy
    or with none, at the top of the render and as an item of a list (`Widget "w": an `items`
    array on an object of a kind that is no list (example.com/v1 Widget) is read as a list by
    what applies the output, which would apply its entries in the object's place; write the
    entries as documents of their own, or give the object a kind ending in List`). The parser
    reads such a document as one object. What applies the output tells a list by that array
    and not by the kind, so the entries would reach the cluster without any check here having
    read them. It is the envelope `passthrough` refuses (**Lists**, under `passthrough`), and
    the one refused on a registered kind that declares no `items` (*Undeclared fields*,
    below). An `items` that is no array, or one below the top level, is the object's own
    content. The refusal is no refusal by the policy and carries no class. Under template
    delivery it is still the component's `oam.ViolationError`, as every render that does not
    decode is, since the chart is rendered at the transform's policy step; a `manifests`
    source reports it as its parse error, without one;
  - a document the decoder of its kind panics on is a build error, not a crash. The API type
    of a registered kind may decode itself and not handle what was written: Cilium's ICMP
    field dereferences the `type` an `icmps` field of a `CiliumNetworkPolicy` or a
    `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` left out. Since go-kure/kure#1009 kure's parser reports
    the panic itself, as that document's parse error. The error names the object by its kind
    and its name and holds the panic (`decoding rendered manifests: parse error in Kubernetes
    object: failed to decode object: the decoder panicked on CiliumNetworkPolicy "demo/p":
    runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`); it names neither the
    field nor the document's position, and an item of a list by its position in the list
    (`item 0 of List`). Such a document is one bad document among the others: the error holds
    every document's own, and the YAML error of input that stops being YAML further down.
    Before that change launcher caught the panic itself, named the document by its position
    (`document 2 (CiliumNetworkPolicy "demo/p")`) and reported that document alone;
  - malformed JSON the decoder cannot read past is a build error: `{]`, alone or after JSON
    documents. What follows it in the input is not read. Before go-kure/kure#1012 kure's
    parser did not return on such input, and neither did the build;
  - which kinds are registered is kure's to say. Since go-kure/kure#1007 a MetalLB `BGPPeer`
    at `metallb.io/v1beta2`, the version MetalLB stores, is one, beside `v1beta1`.
    **Breaking** for a chart or a manifest source that holds such a document, which was
    emitted as rendered: it is now emitted as its Go type, so `spec.passwordSecret: {}` is
    written where the document left the field out, and a field of the wrong type
    (`holdTime: [1]`) is a build error. One that sets an undeclared field is still emitted as
    rendered (*Undeclared fields*, below);
  - a list document where a `helm.sh/hook` annotation is involved is a build error naming the
    list: the annotation on the list's own metadata, or on one of its items (for a `v1` `List`
    and a list of an unregistered kind, whose items are documents of their own, at every
    depth the parser opens). Helm reads a hook on the rendered document's own
    metadata and nowhere else, and the parser reads only a list's items. So the items of a hook
    list would be emitted as ordinary resources, and an item's own annotation, which Helm does
    not read, would group it as a hook or drop it. The check reads a list as the parser does,
    with one addition: Helm reads `metadata` under any case of the key and the parser reads
    the exact key, so a hook on a list under `Metadata` is refused here. A list without the
    annotation, and without any other label or annotation of its own, builds; an object that
    is not a list keeps its hook.

  A decode failure is reported as `decoding rendered manifests: …`. `Generate` returns a fresh
  copy of the decoded objects on every call, as `manifests` does, so a trait that decorates a
  typed workload (`topology-spread`, `security-context`, a mounted `configmap`,
  `external-secret`) acts on a chart's Deployment as on an authored one, and generating the
  same result twice gives the same output.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` holds the chart to the environment policy in two steps
  (go-kure/launcher#791); the transform calls it with `NoopPolicy` when no policy is passed.
  - *The source, before any fetch.* The host of `source.url` must match an entry of the policy's
    allowed registries (`AllowedRegistries`) exactly, as for `oci`, `crd` and `manifests`; for an
    `oci://` URL that is its first segment, which is what the Helm registry client pulls from. A
    refused source fails before any request is made: only an allowed source is rendered. No
    allowlist, or an empty one, permits every host.
  - *Every emitted workload.* The chart is then rendered — in the transform, so a fetch or render
    failure is reported there, as that component's policy error — and each Pod, PodTemplate,
    ReplicationController, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Job and CronJob in it,
    a kept hook's included, is checked as an authored workload is: host namespaces, hostPath
    volumes, the cpu/memory maxima, the storage maximum on a generic ephemeral volume's claim,
    the registry allowlist on an image volume's reference (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790:
    a chart that renders one from a registry outside the list built before; see *Image volumes*
    under **pod**),
    and for every init and regular container the registry allowlist, the privileged, HostProcess
    and capability gates, and `ValidateImageRef` (no untagged image, no `:latest`), which holds
    the reference of an image volume too (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: a chart that
    renders an untagged or `:latest` one built before). Ephemeral
    containers are refused. The storage a PersistentVolumeClaim, or a StatefulSet's claim
    template, requests is held to the storage maximum (`MaxStorageSize`), as the
    `persistentvolumeclaim` and `statefulset` kinds hold theirs. The replica count of a
    Deployment, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet or ReplicationController (one when the chart sets none)
    and the `maxReplicas` of a HorizontalPodAutoscaler, in any API version, are held to the
    replica maximum (`MaxReplicas`), as the `deployment` and `statefulset` kinds and the
    `scaler` trait hold theirs. A PersistentVolume is held to what the `persistentvolume`
    kind holds its own to: a `hostPath` or `local` source needs `AllowHostPathVolumes()`,
    and `spec.capacity.storage` is held to the storage maximum (breaking for a chart that
    renders one; see **persistentvolume**). The error names the rendered
    object and the field (`helmtemplate: rendered Deployment "demo/web":
    spec.template.spec.containers[0] "app": …`).

  **Behaviour change:** a chart that renders a privileged container, a host namespace or a
  hostPath volume no longer builds unless the policy allows it — and with no policy passed
  nothing allows it, since `NoopPolicy` denies all five. The policy accessors that allow such a
  chart are `AllowPrivileged()`, `AllowHostNetwork()`, `AllowHostPID()`, `AllowHostIPC()` and
  `AllowHostPathVolumes()`; there is no per-chart exemption. A chart image without a tag, or
  tagged `:latest`, has to be pinned through the chart's values.

  **Undeclared fields** (go-kure/launcher#794, item 7). Kure's parser decodes a registered kind
  leniently: a field the vendored API type does not declare — one a newer Kubernetes version
  added, say — is dropped, with no error. The policy check reads that type, so it would pass a
  workload whose undeclared pod spec field it never saw, and the object would be written
  without the field. Template delivery, `manifests`, `crd` and `passthrough` therefore decode
  each document of a registered kind once more, strictly, over the same scheme, and act on
  what that reports:
  - *A workload or a claim* — the kinds the policy check reads as Go types: Pod, PodTemplate,
    ReplicationController, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Job, CronJob,
    PersistentVolumeClaim and PersistentVolume, which "a workload or a claim" stands for
    wherever this rule is cited — that sets an undeclared field is refused, under any policy
    and with none. A kind the check comes to read as its Go type joins them. The error names the object and the path of every such field (`decoding rendered
    manifests: Deployment "demo/web": undeclared field
    spec.template.spec.fieldOfALaterVersion: the apps/v1 Deployment type this build reads the
    object with does not declare it, so the object cannot be checked against environment
    policy`).
  - *Any other registered kind* is emitted as the document was rendered, unstructured, the
    field kept. A HorizontalPodAutoscaler is one of these: the check reads its `maxReplicas`
    from the unstructured object as it does from the Go type. One shape is refused: a
    top-level `items` array on a kind that declares none, since written out the object is a
    list to whatever applies it, and its items would be applied in its place.

  A list (a `v1` `List`, a typed list, a list of an unregistered kind) is replaced by its
  items, so the rule is each item's: an item is refused or kept as a document of its own is,
  the error naming its position (`decoding rendered manifests: item 1 of List: Deployment
  "demo/web": undeclared field …`; `item 0 of WidgetList: item 0 of List: …` for a list in a
  list). A kept item that left `apiVersion` and `kind` out is written with the ones its list
  gives it: the kind a typed list holds, and for a list of an unregistered kind the list's
  `apiVersion` and its kind without `List`. The list's other fields are not read: the list
  is never emitted. A document whose items cannot be matched to the objects the parser made
  of them is refused, not passed with an item unread.

  A key written twice is not an undeclared field and is read as before (the last value
  stands). One case of it is refused, whatever the kind: a JSON document that writes so
  many keys twice that the strict decode's record of errors, which holds a hundred, is
  full without naming an undeclared field. Whether such a document also sets one cannot
  be told. (A document whose undeclared field is recorded before the record fills is
  treated as any other: refused as a workload or a claim, kept as another kind.)

  Another is an item of a list of an unregistered kind, in a JSON document, that states
  `apiVersion` or `kind` and then `null` for it. The parser reads the last statement, takes
  the `null` for the key left out and gives the item its list's; the strict decode keeps the
  string the `null` follows. Where that string is what the list gives too, the two agree
  and nothing changes. Where it is not, the strict decode checks the fields of another kind
  than the one emitted, and an item the parser made a Go type of is refused, with or without
  an undeclared field
  (`item 0 of FooList: Deployment "web": the object was read as apps/v1 Deployment, and the
  decode that checks its fields reads the document as example.com/v1 Deployment, so its
  fields cannot be checked; a second apiVersion or kind that is null is the known cause,
  state each once`). The parser refuses the same in an item of a typed list itself. An item
  the parser leaves untyped, its kind not registered at the list's `apiVersion`, is emitted
  as the parser read it and is not checked as the kind the strict decode would read: nothing
  of an unstructured object is dropped.

  Whether a cluster accepts a kept field its own version does not know is not verified
  here; the object reaches it as the chart wrote it.

  **Breaking**, in two ways. A chart that renders a workload or a claim with an undeclared
  field built before, the field dropped from the output, and no longer builds: the field has
  to go, or wait for a launcher whose pinned API types declare it. And the output of every
  other registered kind gains the fields the typed decode had dropped since
  go-kure/launcher#791; such an object is written from the document and not from its Go type,
  so the rest of it is as the chart wrote it too.

  Known limit: a type that unmarshals itself decodes its own keys, so an undeclared key inside
  one is not reported and is still dropped. A CustomResourceDefinition's `items` schema is
  such a type: the same kind of type as a `CiliumNetworkPolicy`'s endpoint selector, which
  the kind inventory records and an authored Cilium policy checks on its own. A key next to
  `properties` in the same schema is reported and kept. No type under a workload or a claim does this beyond scalar
  leaves (`Quantity`, `IntOrString`, `Time`) and the raw field set of `managedFields`; a test
  walks those types and fails when one starts to.

  Limits. The items of a list, whatever its kind, are checked as documents of their own are,
  a list among them opened in turn.
  A workload, claim or PersistentVolume in an API version kure's scheme
  does not register
  (`batch/v1beta1`, `apps/v1beta2`) cannot be read and
  is refused rather than passed unchecked, inside a list as outside one. The decode returns no object with a
  top-level `items` array (*Rendered objects*, above), so the check meets none; one that reaches it
  another way is refused as unreadable. Not checked: an object of a dropped hook (never emitted); the pods a
  custom resource's controller creates, and the replica count a custom resource sets; the host of the chart archive a Helm repository's index
  points at, and any redirect, which kure's renderer follows. That one is a decided limit
  (go-kure/launcher#794, item 6): the allowlist is checked on the chart's source URL before
  anything is fetched, and holding every later request to it needs a hook in kure's chart
  renderer, which takes a release name and a namespace and nothing about its requests
  (`helm.RenderChart`). A nil policy (a direct
  `ApplyPolicy(nil)`, or `Generate` on a config no policy was applied to) checks nothing, and
  `ApplyPolicy(nil)` withdraws no policy applied before. A chart
  delivered as a Flux `HelmRelease` (`helmrelease`, `helm` under `delivery: flux`) is rendered
  on the cluster, so nothing it renders can be checked at build time; only the host of a source
  component in the document is.

  **Hook-group layout.** For a layout-walking consumer (the `layout.LayoutAugmenter` path), more
  than one hook group makes `AugmentLayout` clear the component's flat `Resources` and replace
  them with one child `ManifestLayout` per group, named
  `<application>-<component>-NN-<phase-slug>`, written to
  its own directory `<component dir>/<child>` (its `Namespace` is the component layout's own path,
  which kure joins with the child's name, so a hook-group directory is never nested twice) and
  chained via `DependsOn`, listing each child's preceding sibling in the order kure's
  `helm.SplitByHookWeight` synthesizes from Helm's hook phases — a combined install/upgrade
  ordering for GitOps reconciliation, not Helm's own per-operation execution order (kure
  `pkg/stack/helm/hooks.go:28-36`). `DependsOn` is set on every child, and only kure's
  `FluxIntegratedPerLayout` placement carries it: there kure's layout integrator gives each child
  a Flux Kustomization CR of its own and writes each entry into its `spec.dependsOn` as the name
  of the Kustomization of the sibling the entry names (kure `pkg/stack/layout/manifest.go`'s
  `DependsOn` field doc). Under `FluxSeparate` and `FluxIntegratedPerBundle` a child gets no
  Kustomization of its own, and kure's Flux integration refuses the child's `DependsOn` and
  `KustomizationName`, naming the child (go-kure/kure#1032); before, it dropped them without an
  error, and the order between hook groups was lost. A chart with more than one hook group
  therefore needs `FluxIntegratedPerLayout` under kure's Flux integration. When it
  partitions, `AugmentLayout` also sets the component layout's `ApplicationFileMode` to
  `AppFilePerResource` unless the caller already set one, so the component stays a directory
  whose `kustomization.yaml` lists the children. Without that, a writer-wide `AppFileSingle`
  default (kure `layout.Config.ApplicationFileMode`) would make kure's `WriteManifest` refuse the
  tree under any placement but `FluxIntegratedPerLayout`: an `AppFileSingle` layout writes no
  `kustomization.yaml`, so nothing would list its child layouts (`go-kure/launcher#563`). The
  children carry no mode of their own, so under such a default each hook group is written as one
  file, `<component dir>/<child>.yaml`, instead of a sub-directory, and the component's
  `kustomization.yaml` lists it; under `FluxIntegratedPerLayout` kure's layout integrator keeps
  every child a directory with its own Flux Kustomization, whatever the default. kure names
  that Kustomization `<bundle's Kustomization>-<child>` and shortens it past 63 characters by
  its own rule (go-kure/kure#1030, go-kure/kure#1036), while the child's name, its directory,
  is held to 253 (`pkg/oam/README.md`, "Pipeline"). A single-group
  chart's `AugmentLayout` is a no-op. Every `helmtemplate` component is a `LayoutAugmenter`, a
  hook-free chart included, since the group count is known only after the render — so even a
  hook-free chart gets its own sub-layout directory under a layout-walking consumer, for no
  behavioural benefit. The child name begins with the application name
  (go-kure/launcher#792): component names are unique only within one Application, while the
  Kustomization CRs a consumer generates for the hook-group children of every application can
  share one namespace, so two differently named Applications that each have a component `db`
  get `<application>-db-NN-<phase-slug>` children that differ. The transform hands the config its
  application (`oam.ApplicationNameSetter`, the `Application` field); a `HelmTemplateConfig`
  built directly, outside a transform, has none unless the caller sets the field, and its
  children are then named `<layout name>-NN-<phase-slug>`. **Breaking output change**: every
  hook-group child name, and so its directory and the Flux Kustomization a consumer derives
  from it, gains the leading `<application>-`. The Kustomization kure generates for the child
  under `FluxIntegratedPerLayout` is `<bundle's Kustomization>-<child>`
  (`shop-shop-db-01-main`), and the next group's `spec.dependsOn` follows it. **Breaking output
  change** (go-kure/launcher#941): from go-kure/launcher#787 launcher named it by the child
  alone (`shop-db-01-main`) and shortened it to 63 characters itself; it now leaves the name to
  kure, whose `<unit>-` keeps two applications of one name in different bundles apart, and
  which refuses the name under the coarser placements (go-kure/kure#1032). A layout name over
  253 characters is shortened by the one shortening rule (`oam.ShortenNameWithSuffix`, which
  `helm` uses for its values ConfigMap name): the `-NN-<phase-slug>` suffix is kept whole and `<application>-<component>` becomes
  its own beginning plus 10 hex digits of its sha256 (8 before go-kure/launcher#793), so two
  long names that differ anywhere almost never shorten to the same one. Known limitation: the
  two names are joined by a plain `-`, which either may contain, so application `a-b` with
  component `c` and application `a` with component `b-c` still get the same child names. The
  default carries no namespace either: like the bundle name, a child name is built from the
  application's name alone, so two Applications with one name in different namespaces get the
  same child names. Keeping those apart is the author's or the consumer's: the
  `hookGroupNamePrefix` property, or the `Naming` hook's answer for the `hook-group` role
  (go-kure/launcher#787), replaces `<application>-<component>` in the name of every child,
  directory and Kustomization alike. Such a prefix is a DNS-1123 subdomain and is never
  shortened: a child name over 63 characters built from it fails the transform, in an error
  with the component, the role and the full name (`*oam.HookGroupNameError`, which answers
  to `oam.ErrHookGroupNameTooLong`), and two components of one document that
  resolve to one prefix fail the transform. The transform has the chart rendered by its
  policy step, with or without a policy of the caller's, and asks the config then
  (`CheckHookGroupNames`); `AugmentLayout` returns the same error for a config built
  directly or a prefix set after the transform. Known limit: the transform holds the prefixes
  apart, not the names built from them after the render, so two different prefixes can still
  give one Kustomization name (a written prefix that equals kure's name for another
  component's default child, less its suffix; a prefix that ends as another chart's phase
  begins). kure refuses that name, used twice, when the
  walked tree is integrated; another `hookGroupNamePrefix` on one of the components is the
  way out (`pkg/oam/README.md`, "Name roles and the `Naming` hook"). A `HelmTemplateConfig` built directly sets `HookGroupNamePrefix`.
  The component's own layout, the parent of the hook-group children, also gets a Flux
  Kustomization under `FluxIntegratedPerLayout`, which kure names `<bundle>-<component>` and
  shortens past 63 characters by its own rule; launcher leaves that default to kure.
  **Breaking output change** (go-kure/launcher#941): before, the transform shortened a default
  over 63 characters by launcher's rule and `AugmentLayout` set it on the layout, so such a
  layout's Kustomization name changes. The `layoutKustomizationName` property, or the
  `Naming` hook's answer for the `layout` role, sets another name, a DNS-1123 subdomain of at
  most 63 characters used as written and never shortened; any other fails the transform,
  naming the component and the role. A name set on the layout needs per-layout placement:
  under any other the layout gets no Kustomization of its own, and kure's Flux integration
  refuses the name, naming the layout (go-kure/kure#1032). A
  `HelmTemplateConfig` built directly sets `LayoutKustomizationName`; `AugmentLayout` never
  overwrites a `KustomizationName` the layout already carries. `GenerateCoversAugmentLayout` is always true —
  `Generate`'s output is already the flat union `AugmentLayout` repartitions — so `kurel build`,
  which never walks a layout, accepts the component and emits `Generate`'s flat output.
- **oci** — `source.url` (`oci://…`), `source.name` (a name for the generated
  OCIRepository, see below), `source.objectName` (a name for the OCIRepository
  the component keeps to itself, see below), `kustomizationName` (a name for
  the Kustomization, see below), `version` (tag or `sha256:…`), `path`,
  `prune`, `interval`, `targetNamespace`, `wait`, `healthChecks`.

  **Lowering (go-kure/launcher#784).** `oci` is a role-named component: `OCIRule`
  lowers it to the two kind-named terminals it stands for, an `ocirepository`
  (`url`, `ref.tag` from `version`, or `ref.digest` for a `sha256:` value, and
  the authored `interval`) and a `fluxcd-kustomization` (`path`, `prune`,
  `sourceRef`, and `interval`, `targetNamespace`, `wait` and `healthChecks`
  when set). No handler is registered for `oci`. The rule runs the checks
  below first, with their `oci:` messages; everything past them is the
  terminals' own.
  - *A component alone on its artifact* lowers to a same-name group: both
    objects are named after the component (unless `kustomizationName` or
    `source.objectName` names them, below) and deploy as one unit, the
    OCIRepository first. This is the pair of objects `oci` has always emitted,
    byte for byte. Annotations go to both members, so a tier annotation, a
    `placement` policy or a `dependency` rule naming the component acts on the
    pair. `prune-protection` and `force-replace` cover both objects (the
    pair's application takes the delivery intent); every other trait goes to
    the Kustomization.
  - *Two or more `oci` components of one document on the same source* share
    it. The source then belongs to the document, not to the component that
    comes first: it is emitted once, named `<document>-source-<digest>` (the
    10-hex digest of the source identity, through
    `LoweringContext.ResolveSharedName`, which shortens a default over 253
    characters by the one rule), and each component lowers to its Kustomization alone,
    referencing it and ordered after it (`Component.OrderAfter`). Like a
    source `helm` generates, it is then a generated source: `pkg/oam` applies
    it with the application bundle, ahead of every group, wherever its
    consumers are placed. It carries no trait and no annotation of any
    consumer, and may not be placed in a tier or made to wait on a component.
    The consumer's `Naming` hook may rename it: it is asked under role
    `helm-source`, once for each source identity of a document, with that
    default and no component (go-kure/launcher#787).
  - *`source.name` names the source* (go-kure/launcher#787), and makes it the
    shared form whatever the number of consumers: the OCIRepository is emitted
    once under that name, applied with the application bundle ahead of every
    group, and the component lowers to its Kustomization alone. **A source
    named this way carries no annotations and no traits of the component**, not
    even for a component alone on its artifact: `prune-protection` and
    `force-replace` then cover the Kustomization only, and a tier annotation
    places only the Kustomization. The name is the component's own choice.
    Components that write the same name for the same identity share the source;
    a component that writes none does not share it and is not counted among
    its consumers, so it keeps its own source, or shares the document's with
    the other components that name none. A name equal to that shared source's
    own names that source: one name for one identity is one source. The name
    is used as written: it must
    be a DNS-1123 subdomain of at most 253 characters, and cannot be the
    component's own name or that of another component of the document (`oci:
    source.name "base" is the component's own name; the generated source is a
    component of the document too, so give it another name`). One name for two
    identities is refused as a collision. `source.name: ""` reads as absent.
  - *`kustomizationName` and `source.objectName` name the two objects that
    carry the component's name* (go-kure/launcher#787): the Kustomization, in
    both forms, and the source a component keeps to itself. Each is the
    author's property, else the consumer's `Naming` hook's answer (roles
    `oci-kustomization` and `oci-source`, asked with the component), else the
    component name, so a document that sets neither and a hook that declines
    give the same output as before. A name that is not the default is used as
    written: a DNS-1123 subdomain of at most 253 characters, refused otherwise
    and never shortened. It names the object alone. Both members keep the
    component's name, so the pair stays one unit: a tier annotation, a
    `placement` policy or a `dependency` rule naming the component still acts
    on both, and the traits go where they went. The Kustomization's `sourceRef`
    names the kept source by the name that object takes. Every one of these
    names is claimed, the default included, so an authored `ocirepository` or
    `fluxcd-kustomization` component whose `objectName` is the same name is
    refused in the transform with both named:

    ```
    name collision: OCIRepository.source.toolkit.fluxcd.io "default/manifests" is named by component "manifests" (role "oci-source", its default) and by component "repo" (role "object", set by properties.objectName); give one of them another name
    ```

    `source.objectName` and `source.name` both name the OCIRepository, in two
    ways, and are refused together. Write `source.objectName` to rename the
    source the component keeps to itself: it stays with the Kustomization and
    carries the component's annotations and its `prune-protection` and
    `force-replace` traits. Write `source.name` for a source generated on its
    own, which components that write the same name share. A component that
    writes `source.objectName` keeps its own source whatever other component
    has the same identity, and is not counted among the consumers of a shared
    one.
  - *The source identity* is the `url`, the `version` and the effective
    `interval`. Unset, `0s`, `60m` and `1h` are one interval. Components
    whose intervals differ do not share: each keeps a source of its own,
    polling at its own interval, as a component alone on its artifact does.
    An `oci` and a `helm` component on one artifact never share either: the
    identities differ, and a Helm source copies the chart layer instead of
    extracting it.

  **Output changes.** For a document in which several `oci` components
  reconcile one artifact, the OCIRepository is renamed from the name of the
  component deployed first to `<document>-source-<digest>`. It is applied
  with the application bundle, ahead of every group, instead of with that
  component, so the application has an ordered group even when the document
  declares no order. That component's `prune-protection` or `force-replace`
  no longer covers it. The rename also happens when a second consumer
  is added to a document that had one, and is undone when it is removed.
  Components that shared one source while their intervals differed now emit
  one source each. `interval: 0s` now emits the 60m default on both objects,
  since both terminals read a zero interval as unset; it used to be emitted
  as `0s`. Nothing else changes.

  Sharing is decided among the `oci` components the document holds when the
  rule runs: an `oci` component a third-party rule emits in a later lowering
  round is not counted as a consumer of a source lowered before it.

  **Messages.** The checks the rule runs keep their `oci:` text. A lowering
  refusal is reported with the component and its document
  (`component "x" (type "oci") in document …: oci: version is required …`).
  The registry allowlist is the `ocirepository` terminal's check, so its
  refusals name that kind and its field (`ocirepository: url: …`) rather
  than `oci: source.url`.

  `targetNamespace` has no default (go-kure/launcher#622). Unset, the
  Kustomization emits no `spec.targetNamespace` and each object keeps the
  namespace the artifact's own kustomize build gives it: the one it carries,
  or a `namespace` set in the artifact's `kustomization.yaml`.
  kustomize-controller does not fill in its own namespace for an object that
  still has none. Author `targetNamespace` when namespaced objects are left
  without a namespace after that build: they otherwise fail at apply with
  `namespace not specified`, with or without a Flux namespace. This deliberately differs from `helmrelease`, which under a Flux namespace defaults
  `targetNamespace` to the application namespace. A Kustomization's
  `targetNamespace` sets or overrides the namespace of every namespaced object
  it applies, Flux custom resources included, so a default would move the
  objects of a deliberately multi-namespace artifact.
  `wait` and `healthChecks` are opt-in readiness settings for the delivery
  Kustomization (go-kure/launcher#432). A document in which neither requests
  anything — `wait` absent or `false`, and `healthChecks` absent, null or
  empty — builds the same Kustomization byte for byte, and the default stays
  unset.
  `wait: true` sets `spec.wait`, so Flux reports the Kustomization ready only
  once everything it applied is ready; `false`, like an omitted key, emits
  nothing. `healthChecks` is a list of `{apiVersion, kind, name, namespace}`
  entries copied, in authored order, into `spec.healthChecks`. The component
  delivers an opaque artifact, so the list is authored, never derived.
  `apiVersion` (`apps/v1`, or `v1` for a core kind), `kind` and `name` are
  required non-empty strings, and `namespace` is optional, left out for a
  cluster-scoped kind. Any other key in an entry is refused by name, a
  wrongly typed field is a type error (`healthChecks[0].name: must be a
  string, got int`), and an empty or null list emits nothing. `wait: true`
  together with a non-empty `healthChecks` is refused: kustomize-controller
  ignores `healthChecks` when `wait` is true, so the list would never be
  checked. There is no `timeout` property; Flux's own default applies.
  Under a policy with a non-empty registry allowlist (`AllowedRegistries`),
  `source.url` must name its registry explicitly — `oci://<registry>/<repository>`
  with a non-empty repository and a registry that is `localhost` or contains
  `.` or `:` — and that registry must match an allowlist entry exactly
  (go-kure/launcher#580). Flux's source-controller parses the url with
  go-containerregistry's `name.NewRepository`, which reads any other first
  segment as part of a Docker Hub repository: `oci://ghcr.io` and
  `oci://registry/my-artifact` are pulled from Docker Hub, so they are refused
  even when `ghcr.io` or `registry` is listed. No policy, or an empty
  allowlist, accepts every `oci://` url.
  `interval` (default `60m`) must be a duration Flux accepts, checked exactly as
  for `helmrelease` (go-kure/launcher#590): see its Defaults paragraph.
- **fluxcd-kustomization** — the kind-named terminal for Flux's `Kustomization`
  (go-kure/launcher#784). Its properties are exactly the top-level JSON keys of
  `KustomizationSpec` in the kustomize-controller API version `go.mod` links; a
  test ties the published schema to that struct, so a bump that adds or drops a
  spec field fails the suite until the schema follows. It is an authored Flux
  object, like `helmrelease`: it does not deliver the application it is part
  of, and it creates no source — `sourceRef` names one that exists, authored
  beside it (`ocirepository`, `gitrepository`, `bucket`) or already on the
  cluster. The type is `fluxcd-kustomization` rather than `kustomization`,
  which would read as the `kustomization.yaml` file (go-kure/launcher#352).

  **Decoding.** The whole property map is decoded with `builtin.DecodeStrictJSON`
  into `KustomizationSpec`, so `patches`, `postBuild`, `dependsOn`, `force`,
  `timeout`, `serviceAccountName`, `decryption`, `kubeConfig` and every other
  field are emitted as authored. A key the struct does not declare, at any
  depth, is refused with its path from the property root
  (`unknown field "patches[0].target.kinds"`,
  `builtin.UnknownJSONFieldPath`): the spec declares `kind`, `name` and
  `namespace` in several places, so the bare key would not say where. A
  wrongly typed value is refused too. Keys match case-insensitively, as in
  `encoding/json`; schema validation, which a `kurel build` runs first, is
  exact.

  **Defaults and checks.** `interval` defaults to `60m` when unset (a zero
  duration counts as unset); Flux requires the field. `interval`,
  `retryInterval` and `timeout`, when set, must be durations Flux accepts,
  checked as on `helmrelease`. `sourceRef.kind` is required and one of
  `OCIRepository`, `GitRepository`, `Bucket`, `ExternalArtifact`, the CRD's
  enum; `sourceRef.name` is required. `prune` is a required field of the
  spec with no default here: unset, `false` is emitted (`oci` passes `true`
  unless told otherwise). `targetNamespace` is never defaulted, with or
  without a Flux namespace, for the reason given under **oci**. Nothing else
  is checked: the enums and the cross-field rules are left to the
  Kustomization CRD's own admission, and `wait: true` beside `healthChecks`,
  which `oci` refuses, is emitted as authored (kustomize-controller then
  ignores the list). Whether the source exists is known only on the cluster. The checks run again in `Generate`,
  for a config built directly.

  **Identity and namespaces.** The Kustomization is named after the component
  and lands in the Flux namespace when one is configured, else in the
  application namespace (`SetFluxNamespace`). The ConfigMaps and Secrets it
  reads from its own namespace — `decryption.secretRef`,
  `kubeConfig.secretRef` / `configMapRef` and each `postBuild.substituteFrom`
  entry — must live there too: a `configmap`, `external-secret` or
  `certificate` trait on the component whose object one of them names moves
  with the Kustomization (`FluxNamespaceReads`, go-kure/launcher#740).
  `ApplyPolicy` checks nothing: a Kustomization fetches nothing itself, and
  the registry allowlist applies where its source is authored.
- **helmrepository / ocirepository / gitrepository / bucket / helmchart** — the kind-named
  terminals for Flux's four fetching source kinds (go-kure/launcher#347, part of the Helm-family
  redesign go-kure/launcher#336) and for its `HelmChart` (go-kure/launcher#351), which builds a
  chart artifact from one of them. Each component's properties are exactly the top-level JSON
  keys of its source-controller spec type — `HelmRepositorySpec`, `OCIRepositorySpec`,
  `GitRepositorySpec`, `BucketSpec`, `HelmChartSpec`, in the version `go.mod` links — and a test
  ties each published schema to its struct, so a bump that adds or drops a spec field fails the
  suite until the schema follows.
  Each emits exactly one CR of its kind, named after the component, and nothing else: no
  Kustomization (compare `oci`), no HelmRelease (compare `helmrelease`), no source for a
  `helmchart` (its `sourceRef` names one that exists, as a `helmrelease`'s
  `chart.spec.sourceRef` does), and no source dedup — two components naming the same URL emit
  two CRs. A `helmrelease` consumes a `helmchart` through `chartRef` with `kind: HelmChart`.

  **Decoding.** The whole property map is decoded with `builtin.DecodeStrictJSON` into the spec
  type, with no launcher-owned keys. A key the struct does not declare, at any depth
  (`secretRef.namespace`, a stray key in a GitRepository `include` entry), is refused by name, and
  so is a wrongly typed value (`suspend: "yes"`, an unparsable duration). The schema keeps the
  nested Flux blocks as open objects; the strict decode is what checks them. A reflection test
  asserts, per kind, that no spec field is unreachable through that decode, against an explicit
  exclusion list that is empty. Keys match case-insensitively, as in `encoding/json`; schema
  validation, which a `kurel build` runs first, is exact.

  **Checks and defaults.** Required: `url` on `helmrepository`, `ocirepository` and
  `gitrepository`; `bucketName` and `endpoint` on `bucket`; `chart`, `sourceRef.kind` and
  `sourceRef.name` on `helmchart`. A `url` must start with a scheme the
  CRD's own pattern admits: `http://`, `https://` or `oci://` for `helmrepository`, and only
  `oci://` under `type: oci`; `oci://` for `ocirepository`; `http://`, `https://` or `ssh://` for
  `gitrepository`, so an scp-style `git@host:org/repo` is refused — write
  `ssh://git@host/org/repo`. The CRD has no pattern for `endpoint`, so it is only required.
  `interval` defaults to `60m` when unset (a zero duration counts as unset), matching the
  `helmrelease` default; a `helmrepository` with `type: oci` gets no default, since Flux
  does not poll it, and its emitted `interval` reads `0s`, the value the Go type always writes.
  A set `interval` must be a duration Flux accepts, checked exactly as on `helmrelease`
  (go-kure/launcher#601); under `type: oci` too, where the CRD pattern still applies.
  A set `timeout` (a `helmchart` has none) is checked the same way, against the source CRDs'
  narrower pattern, which has
  no `h` unit: `^([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?(ms|s|m))+$` (go-kure/launcher#606), so an authored `1h` is
  refused. A `timeout` of an hour or more authored in minutes or seconds (`90m`, `3600s`) is
  accepted and emitted with its hours folded into minutes: `90m0s`, `60m0s`
  (go-kure/launcher#619). A `metav1.Duration` would write `Duration.String()`, `1h30m0s`, which
  the CRD rejects, so such a source is emitted as an unstructured object carrying that text; a
  `timeout` below an hour, or none, leaves the source emitted exactly as before. A config built
  directly gets the same minutes form.
  An authored `verify` that names no `provider`, on an `ocirepository` or a `helmchart`, is
  written with `provider: cosign`, the API's default, and an authored `provider: ""` is
  refused (go-kure/launcher#790), for the reason given on `helmrelease` above: the Go type
  writes the field whether or not it was authored, so the API's default never applies. A
  config built directly with an empty provider gets the default too.
  `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` holds the five source kinds, with
  `helmrelease` and `fluxcd-kustomization`, to the required fields and the defaults the
  markers of the linked Flux modules state, in the test's two sets only: a required field
  the type leaves out when it is empty, and a default the type writes over unauthored. The
  seven have four such fields: `chart.spec.sourceRef.kind` on `helmrelease`, refused, and
  `verify.provider` on that kind's chart, on `ocirepository` and on `helmchart`, filled.
  Nothing else is checked or defaulted: enums (`type`, `provider`, `layerSelector.operation`,
  `verify.mode`, a HelmChart's `sourceRef.kind` and `reconcileStrategy`) and cross-field rules
  (a Bucket's `sts` against its `provider`, `serviceAccountName` against `secretRef`, a
  HelmChart's `verify` only with a HelmRepository source) are left to the CRD's own admission.
  Nor is the source a `helmchart` names: whether it exists, or is of the kind `sourceRef.kind`
  says, is known only on the cluster.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` checks the host the source is fetched from against the policy's
  allowed registries (`AllowedRegistries`), with the same exact match `oci`, `crd` and
  `manifests` apply: the `url` host for the three repositories, the `endpoint` host for `bucket`.
  A port is part of the host, so `registry.local:5000` matches only an entry with that port. The
  user of an `ssh://` URL is dropped (`ssh://git@github.com/org/repo` checks `github.com`);
  userinfo on an `http://`, `https://` or `oci://` URL is not, so such a URL matches no entry and
  is refused. An empty allowlist permits every host, and none of the rules below applies. A
  `helmchart` checks nothing: it fetches from the source its `sourceRef` names, whose host is
  checked where that source is authored, as for a `helmrelease`.

  No refusal prints the value it refused, since a URL or `endpoint` can carry a credential in
  its userinfo (the user included), path, query or IPv6 zone (go-kure/launcher#699). An
  allowlist refusal names the host as `displayHost` reduces the url's raw authority (an
  `ssh://` user included, not the host the match used): without userinfo, query, fragment or
  zone, port kept, saying when something was dropped; the matching itself is unchanged. It
  names no host at all when the reduced text is not a plain host (a DNS name, IPv4 address or
  bracketed IPv6 address, with an optional numeric port), or when a `[`, `]`, `?` or `#`, none
  of which a userinfo may hold, precedes the last `@`, which may then sit inside IPv6 brackets
  or a query instead. A scheme refusal (the four sources', `oci`'s, and `crd`'s and
  `manifests`' `http`/`https` check) and the explicit-registry refusal below name only the
  component, the field and the form expected, and the Amazon S3 refusal names the reduced host.

  Some sources are not fetched from the host their field names, so the check follows Flux instead:

  - *An `oci://` URL must name its registry explicitly.* Flux parses an OCIRepository `url`, and a
    Helm OCI chart reference when it verifies the chart's signature, with go-containerregistry,
    which takes the first path segment as the registry only when a `/` follows it and it is
    `localhost` or contains `.` or `:`; anything else is a Docker Hub repository. So
    `oci://ghcr.io` and `oci://registry/app` are pulled from Docker Hub, whichever entry their
    first segment matched. Under a non-empty allowlist such a URL is refused, with an error
    asking for a qualified registry (`oci://docker.io/library/app`,
    `oci://registry.example:5000/org/app`). An `ocirepository` `url` also needs a repository
    path after the registry; a `helmrepository` `oci://` URL, of either `type`, may stop at the
    registry (`oci://ghcr.io`), since Flux appends the chart name to it.
  - *A `bucket` with `provider: gcp` is checked against `storage.googleapis.com`.* Flux's GCP
    client never reads `endpoint`; it uses Google Cloud Storage's own host. The `generic`, `aws`
    and `azure` providers, and no provider, fetch from `endpoint`, which stays the host checked,
    except as the next rule says.
  - *A `bucket` with an Amazon S3 `endpoint` is refused, unless its provider is `azure` or
    `gcp`.* The S3 client behind `generic`, `aws` and no provider does not fetch from an Amazon
    S3 endpoint: it contacts the S3 host of `region`, which may name any AWS region or partition,
    or of the bucket's own location when `region` is unset, chosen at runtime. That host cannot
    be checked, so under a non-empty allowlist the build fails, even when the allowlist lists the
    endpoint. The test errs broad, since it fails closed: any `endpoint` containing `amazonaws`,
    in any case, counts, because the client's own host patterns also match look-alikes such as
    `s3.x-amazonaws.com`.

  Hosts a source reaches indirectly are not checked: the chart URLs a Helm repository index
  advertises on other hosts (what `passCredentials` exists for), a Bucket's `sts.endpoint`, the
  token endpoints a `provider` authenticates against, and a proxy. Apart from the two `bucket`
  cases above, a `provider`, `region` or `insecure` setting changes how the source authenticates
  or which scheme it uses, not which host it fetches from.

  **Namespace and references.** The CR lands in the Flux namespace when one is configured, else in
  the application namespace (`SetFluxNamespace`). Every local reference it carries — `secretRef`,
  `certSecretRef`, `proxySecretRef`, the Secret references under `verify` and `sts`,
  `serviceAccountName`, a GitRepository `include`, a HelmChart's `sourceRef` — resolves in the
  namespace the CR lands in, so under a Flux namespace the objects it names must live there. A
  `helmchart` whose `sourceRef` names a source component in the same document finds it there:
  both move to the Flux namespace. So does the Secret of an `external-secret` or `certificate`
  trait (or the ConfigMap of a `configmap` trait) on the component when one of the Secret
  references names it — a `certSecretRef` naming a `certificate` trait's `secretName` moves that
  Certificate
  (`FluxNamespaceReads`, go-kure/launcher#740); a trait object no reference names stays in the
  application namespace.

  **Generated by the `helm` rule.** An inline source on a `helm` component generates one of
  these components: a `helmrepository` for an `http(s)://` URL; an `ocirepository` for an
  `oci://` URL, with a `ref.tag` from `version` and a `layerSelector` copying the Helm chart
  content layer; a `gitrepository` for `kind: GitRepository` with its URL and one `source.ref`
  field; or a `bucket` for `kind: Bucket` with `endpoint` and `bucketName` and no URL. It is
  named `<app>-source-<digest>` and shared by every `helm` component with the same source
  identity (see **helm**). An authored source component exposes the whole spec
  (credentials, `type: oci`, `provider`, verification, …) and is never shared. The rule never
  generates a `helmchart`.
- **postgresql** — `provider: cnpg`, `version` (default `16`), `storageSize`
  (precedence: authored > policy default `storageSize` > `1Gi`), `replicas`,
  `backup.*`, `monitoring.enabled`, `pooler.enabled`, `poolerName`, `managedRoles`,
  `databases` (each with an optional `objectName`), `clusterObjectName`,
  `objectStoreObjectName`.
  **`clusterObjectName` names the Cluster in place of the component name.
  CloudNativePG derives the Cluster's Services and Secrets from the Cluster's
  name, the default backup path moves with it, and renaming an existing
  Cluster creates a new one: the old one is pruned with its data unless it is
  protected** (see "The Cluster's and the ObjectStore's names" below).
  **A component lowering rule** (`PostgresqlRule`, `postgresql_lowering.go`,
  go-kure/launcher#281), not a dispatchable handler: it reads the properties
  as before (`Parse`; the published schema is pinned byte for byte,
  `testdata/postgresql-property-schema.json`: the former handler's, with
  `poolerName`, `clusterObjectName` and `objectStoreObjectName` added) and emits
  the CNPG kind components that build the same objects — a `cnpg-cluster`
  under the component's name, a `cnpg-objectstore` under the same name (one
  same-name sibling group) when `objectStore` is set, a `cnpg-pooler`
  `<name>-pooler` when `pooler.enabled`, and a `cnpg-database` `<name>-<db>`
  per `databases` entry (a Database given the Pooler's name, by default the
  one named `pooler` beside an enabled pooler, joins its same-name sibling
  group, as two objects of different kinds). `replicas` and `storageSize` are written to the
  Cluster only when authored, so the policy applies to them exactly as
  before. The two values postgresql derived from the policy are set after
  it by a post-policy step the rule attaches to the Cluster
  (`oam.Component.AfterPolicy`), which runs before the authored traits:
  `enablePDB` (`instances > 1`) and the `1Gi` storage fallback, under the
  policy maximum with postgresql's text (`storageSize "1Gi" exceeds enforced
  maximum "512Mi"`). Authored traits go to the Cluster, and those that
  covered every object postgresql generated are forwarded to the other
  members so they still do: `prune-protection` and `force-replace` to each
  member, and `fluxcd-patches` and `fluxcd-postbuild` (not built in; a consumer
  that delivers through Flux registers them) to the first member that is
  ordered after the Cluster (below): the members share one group, so one of
  them carries the trait for that group's bundle. For that reason a document
  that authors one of these two traits on the postgresql component may not
  order or place a member on its own (a `dependency` rule or a `placement`
  whose component is the Pooler's or a Database's generated name): the
  member could leave the group the trait reaches, so the rule refuses it and
  asks for the postgresql component's name instead (the rule for every
  lowering rule, and the message, are under "Traits a lowering rule
  forwards"). Policies that name the
  postgresql component are extended to the members the same way. A `placement` of it is repeated
  for each member, so they stay in the Cluster's tier and, without a
  dependency policy, in its bundle. When the document orders its components
  with a `dependency` policy that has a rule, the rule adds one making the
  Pooler and the Databases depend on the Cluster, and every component the
  document makes depend on the postgresql component depend on them too:
  the members are then in a later group than the Cluster's. Without one it adds
  no edge, since a dependency edge would order a document that never asked
  for ordering. The policies it adds are named `<name>-dependencies` and
  `<name>-placement-<i>` (one per member), or, when a policy of the document
  already uses the name, the first free one with `-<n>` appended.
  **Behavior-changing** under `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`
  (go-kure/launcher#281): with both `objectStore` and `pooler`, the objects
  now come in the order Cluster, ObjectStore, Pooler (was Cluster, Pooler,
  ObjectStore; the objects are the same), and a Database named `pooler`
  comes right after the Pooler, ahead of the other Databases. Under a
  `dependency` policy the Pooler and the Databases are deployed from
  one bundle they share, after the Cluster's, unless the document orders
  or places a generated member on its own (was one bundle for all of
  postgresql's objects). A Pooler or Database name, generated or
  chosen, that is already the name of another component in the
  document is refused, naming both. A database name repeated in
  `databases` is refused, naming both entries: each entry is one Database
  object, so the Flux build already failed on it, and the plain manifest
  output carried duplicate Database documents (kubectl kept the last). The Cluster kind's policy checks now
  apply, under its field names: the registry allowlist on the image
  (`imageName`, derived or authored), and `instances`/`storage.size` in the
  policy messages. Refusals the API server or the operator gave at apply
  now come at build: a resource request above its limit, a database named
  `postgres`, `template0`, `template1` or not a DNS-1123 subdomain, and an
  authored `storageSize: ""` (`storageSize: must not be empty; omit it to
  take the policy default or 1Gi`), which built a Cluster CloudNativePG's
  webhook refuses ("Size not configured").
  The component name becomes the Cluster's name and its `cnpg.io/cluster`
  endpoint selector unless the Cluster is named apart (`clusterObjectName`
  or the `Naming` hook, below), so it carries cnpg-cluster's name rule: a DNS-1035
  label (no leading digit, no dot) of at most 50 characters. Any other name
  is refused when the rule lowers it and when endpoints are collected
  (`postgresql name "db.main": must be a DNS-1035 label of at most 50
  characters …`). The cap also keeps both endpoint selector values, the
  name and the pooler's default `<name>-pooler`, within the 63-character label-value
  limit (a `poolerName` or a hook-given name is held to it as a DNS-1035
  label, and so is the default where the Cluster is named apart and the
  component name is not bounded by the Cluster's rule). **Behavior-changing** under `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`:
  such a name used to build and was then refused by CloudNativePG at apply,
  or, over 63 characters (56 with the pooler), gave a network-policy
  selector the API server refuses; it is now refused at build
  (go-kure/launcher#615, go-kure/launcher#589).
  An authored `version: ""` is refused by name (`version: must not be empty;
  omit it to default to "16"`), with or without `imageName`: it used to be
  kept as a value, so without `imageName` the cluster image was
  `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:` — an empty tag that only the image
  pull rejected (go-kure/launcher#539). Only an omitted or null `version`
  takes the default. `storageSize: ""` is refused (above).
  The image is held to the tag rule (`ValidateImageRef`), with or without a
  policy (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790). Without `imageName` the image
  is `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:<version>`, so a `version` that makes
  a `:latest` reference, or none that parses, is refused under the property
  the author wrote, with the image it made: `version: "latest" is refused as
  the tag of the default image: image
  "ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:latest" rejected: :latest tag not
  allowed; use an explicit version tag or digest`. An authored `imageName`
  is refused under `imageName`; `version` is read for the default image only
  and is not checked beside one. The default `version` builds.
  `pooler.image` is the PgBouncer image, written to the Pooler's
  `pgbouncer.image` and held to the tag rule under its own name
  (`pooler.image: image "…" rejected: …`) and, by the `cnpg-pooler` the pooler
  lowers to, to the registry allowlist. Like the other pooler settings it
  needs `pooler.enabled`. Without it the CloudNativePG operator chooses the
  PgBouncer image, so under a non-empty allowlist an enabled pooler without
  `pooler.image` is refused (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: it built
  before), reported under the Pooler's component name:
  `pgbouncer.image (pooler.image on a postgresql component): unset, so the
  CloudNativePG operator chooses the image the pods run, which the allowed
  registries [...] cannot hold; name an image from one of them`. Set
  `pooler.image` to an image from the list. With no allowlist nothing
  changes.
  Any other storage size the Cluster would carry, authored or from the
  policy default, must parse and be positive (`storageSize: quantity must be
  positive, got "0"`): CloudNativePG's webhook parses only the size, so a
  zero or negative one was admitted and its claims failed the API server's
  positive storage-request check. A policy storage-size default is checked
  when it is applied (`policy default for storage.size: invalid quantity
  "lots"`), as the cpu/memory defaults are. The instance count must be at
  least 1, the CRD's minimum: a replicas policy default of 0 is refused
  (`instances: must be >= 1, got 0 from the policy default`), and so is an
  authored `replicas: 0` when the rule lowers it (`replicas: must be >= 1,
  got 0`).
  **Behavior-changing** under `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`: an authored
  `replicas: 0` or a non-positive `storageSize` used to build and was then
  refused at apply; it is now refused at build (go-kure/launcher#623).
  `resources` forwards every name the shared parser admits — `cpu`, `memory`,
  `ephemeral-storage`, `hugepages-<size>` and qualified extended resources
  such as `nvidia.com/gpu`, under the same validation as the other seven
  workload kinds — onto the Cluster's `spec.resources` `requests`/`limits`
  unchanged (go-kure/launcher#484; until then any name other than
  `cpu`/`memory` was rejected, so this is an additive change). Only
  `cpu`/`memory` carry a policy default and maximum; CNPG-specific sizing
  such as `ephemeralVolumesSizeLimit` is not derived from these entries.
  CNPG copies this block onto the instance pods unchanged and nothing
  defaults cpu/memory into it except a policy, so generation refuses a block
  that names `hugepages-<size>` without `cpu` or `memory` on either side
  after policy defaults (`resources: hugepages require cpu or memory in
  requests or limits`) — admission would refuse every instance pod.
  `affinity` takes the same four keys as the shared `affinity` property
  (`enablePodAntiAffinity`, `topologyKey`, `podAntiAffinityType`,
  `nodeSelector`) with the same defaults — `kubernetes.io/hostname` and
  `preferred` — but the handler parses it itself into the CNPG
  `AffinityConfiguration` instead of calling `parseAffinity`, because CNPG
  carries its own affinity shape rather than a `corev1.Affinity`. The block
  and each of its four sub-fields are read with the presence-reporting
  helpers, so a value authored with the wrong type is rejected by name
  (`affinity.topologyKey: must be a string, got float64`) rather than
  discarded while a default reaches the emitted cluster, and
  `podAntiAffinityType` must be `preferred` or `required` — an explicit empty
  string is an error here, not a fallback to the default
  (go-kure/launcher#448). Rejection reaches the `nodeSelector` **values**, not
  just its envelope: `nodeSelector: {rack: 3}` is refused by key rather than
  dropped, so a selector cannot silently reach the cluster narrower than
  authored. When more than one entry is wrong, the **alphabetically first**
  offending key is the one reported: Go randomises map iteration order, so
  without an explicit sort the same document names a different key run to run
  and its diagnostic cannot be reproduced or asserted in a test. The same
  ordering rule applies to the other three parsers in this package that report
  a bad map entry by key — `parseResourceList`, `rejectUnknownKeys` and
  `parseManifestSource`. An explicit **null** `affinity` is **absence** —
  Launcher supplies no explicit affinity settings, exactly as when the
  property is omitted — matching what `pkg/oam`'s own property validation
  already does with a null under an optional property; without that,
  `affinity:` with no value validated against the published schema and then
  failed to convert, while the same value built in Go turned pod
  anti-affinity on with every default. A null on a sub-field *inside* a
  present block is also absence — it takes the same default an omitted
  sub-field takes (go-kure/launcher#444 established this nested-null contract
  in the shared presence primitive `authoredValue`, which this block's four
  sub-fields go through; a nested key read raw elsewhere, such as a probe
  handler key, does not follow it); a non-null wrong-typed sub-field, and an
  explicitly empty `podAntiAffinityType`, remain errors.
  The shared `parseAffinity` (`common.go`) applies the same rules to its
  four sub-fields since go-kure/launcher#452, so the two readers agree; a
  change to one belongs in the other.
  The handler's other string→string maps — `inheritedMetadata.labels`,
  `inheritedMetadata.annotations`, `postgresql.parameters`,
  `pooler.parameters` and `externalClusters[].connectionParameters` — take
  string values only: a non-string value (`tier: 3`,
  `max_connections: 100`, `enabled: true`) is refused by field and key
  (`postgresql.parameters["max_connections"]: must be a string, got int`)
  instead of being dropped from the emitted resources, with the same
  alphabetically-first rule as `nodeSelector` when several are wrong
  (go-kure/launcher#466). Quote such a value to keep it
  (`max_connections: "100"`), and declare a Package parameter substituted as
  a whole value there as `type: string`, since whole-value substitution keeps
  the parameter's type; a number is not converted to its string form,
  because YAML's rendering of a number is not always the text the author
  typed (`1.10` decodes to `1.1`). An explicit null value is absence, per
  "The null contract" below: the key is left out, not refused. The same
  holds for `nodeSelector` values in both affinity readers, which share the
  helper.
  An `objectStore` block emits a barman-cloud `ObjectStore` named after the
  component (or by `objectStoreObjectName` or the `Naming` hook, below) and a
  WAL-archiver entry on the Cluster for the plugin
  `barman-cloud.cloudnative-pg.io`, whose `barmanObjectName` parameter names
  that store by the name it took. An authored `objectStore.serverName` becomes that entry's
  `serverName` parameter, where the plugin reads it (it defaults to the
  Cluster name); the ObjectStore CRD forbids a `configuration.serverName`.
  Until go-kure/launcher#643 the entry named a plugin CloudNativePG does not
  register (`barman-cloud.barmancloud.cnpg.io`) under a key the plugin does
  not read (`objectStoreName`), and `serverName` went on the ObjectStore,
  which the API server refused. No document is newly refused; only the
  emitted output changes.
  Every other optional property the handler reads goes through the same
  presence-reporting helpers (go-kure/launcher#512): `provider`, `version`,
  `storageSize`, `imageName`, the `backup`, `monitoring`, `pooler`,
  `bootstrap`, `replication.synchronous` and `objectStore` blocks and their
  fields, and each entry of `managedRoles`, `databases` (with its
  `extensions`), `externalClusters` and `monitoring.customQueries`. A value of
  the wrong type is refused by its path
  (`managedRoles[0].login: must be a boolean, got string`,
  `databases[0].extensions[1]: must be an object, got string`) where it used
  to be dropped, so `pooler.enabled: "true"` no longer builds a cluster with
  no pooler and `backup: "s3"` no longer builds one with no backup; an
  explicit null is absence, typed or untyped, so a typed-nil `storageSize`
  takes the policy default and a typed-nil `pooler.instances` or
  `replication.synchronous.number` takes the handler default rather than
  being refused as a bad number. Two further shapes that used to vanish are now
  errors: a non-string `managedRoles[].inRoles` entry, and an
  `externalClusters` entry without a `name`. So is a managed role's
  `connectionLimit: 0` (go-kure/launcher#659), as `cnpg-cluster` refuses it:
  CloudNativePG omits a zero `connectionLimit` from the Cluster and applies its
  default `-1`, so the role would deploy with no limit. A role that must not
  connect sets `login: false` instead. The lowering repeats the refusal for a
  `PostgresqlConfig` built directly rather than parsed. `Endpoints` runs the
  rule's lowering on the component, so what the lowering refuses of it has no
  endpoint, in the same words. What a kind it lowers into refuses of a member
  (a database named `postgres`) is not seen there: one of the four things an
  endpoint entry does not see (`pkg/oam`, "Name roles and the `Naming`
  hook").
  **Two object store paths are required** (go-kure/launcher#790):
  `backup.destinationPath` where another value of `backup` is set
  (`retentionPolicy`, `endpointURL` or `secretName`), and
  `barmanObjectStore.destinationPath` of an `externalClusters` entry that has
  a `barmanObjectStore` (`backup.destinationPath: required (…)`,
  `externalClusters[0].barmanObjectStore.destinationPath: required (…)`). The
  Cluster's CRD requires both. Under a `retentionPolicy` that is not empty,
  and in an external cluster's `barmanObjectStore`, the lowering used to
  write `""` where the author wrote nothing, which the API server refuses.
  An `endpointURL`, a `secretName` or an empty `retentionPolicy` without the
  path used to build no backup at all, and is refused as a block that would
  not be built (below). An authored empty path
  is a value: it is written, and refusing it is left to the API server. These
  are two of the strings `cnpg-cluster` refuses unauthored; the
  lowering fills the parent of two more, `bootstrap.pg_basebackup.source` and
  the Cluster's `postgresql.synchronous.method` (authored here as
  `replication.synchronous.method`), only from the string itself, and of the
  other seven never. `TestPostgresqlRule_UnauthoredRequiredStrings` reads all
  eleven in the lowered component. An external cluster's `barmanObjectStore`
  is decoded into the upstream type, which reads a key in any spelling, so
  its path counts as authored in any spelling. The refusal is made on the authored
  properties, so a `PostgresqlConfig` built in Go is not held to it.
  **A block that would not be built is refused, not dropped**
  (go-kure/launcher#790). Five blocks are built only when one field of
  theirs is set, and a document that authored other values of such a block
  without that field used to build with none of them in the result. It is
  refused by the name of the missing field:
  - `backup`: the Cluster's backup is built from `destinationPath`, so
    `endpointURL`, `secretName` or an empty `retentionPolicy` without one is
    refused, as a `retentionPolicy` that is not empty already was
    (`backup.destinationPath: required (…)`, above). An authored empty path
    builds the backup and is written, also without a retention policy.
  - `bootstrap.recovery` and `bootstrap.pg_basebackup`: the bootstrap is
    built from a non-empty `source`, so either block without one is refused
    (`bootstrap.pg_basebackup.source: required (…)`, or `must not be empty
    (…)` for an authored `""`).
  - `replication.synchronous`: built from `method`, so the block without one
    is refused (`replication.synchronous.method: required (any or first)`),
    after a wrongly typed `number` or `dataDurability`, which is still
    refused by its own path.
  - `monitoring`: built when `enabled` is true, so `customQueries` beside an
    `enabled` that is not authored is refused (`monitoring.enabled: required
    where monitoring.customQueries is set (…)`).
  - `pooler`: the Pooler is emitted when `enabled` is true, so `instances`,
    `type`, `poolMode`, `parameters` or `image` beside an `enabled` that is not
    authored is refused (`pooler.enabled: required where pooler.instances is
    set (…)`).

  **An authored `enabled: false` keeps building**, in `pooler` and in
  `monitoring`: `enabled` is the block's own switch, the author wrote "off",
  and the settings beside it are kept in the document for when it is
  switched on. `poolerName` differs (refused whenever `pooler.enabled` is not
  true, an authored false included) because it is a property outside the
  block that names an object which does not exist while the pooler is off.
  A block with nothing in it (`backup: {}`, `bootstrap: {}`, `replication:
  {}`, `monitoring: {}`, `pooler: {}`), or with an empty `customQueries` list
  or `parameters` map only, authors no value and builds as before.
  `TestPostgresqlRule_BlockNotBuilt` holds each case. Breaking for a
  document that authored one of these blocks without its field, among them
  a `backup` with an `endpointURL` or an empty `retentionPolicy` and no
  path, a `bootstrap.pg_basebackup: {}` and a `replication.synchronous`
  with a `number` only. Such a document built,
  without what the author wrote.
  **An authored `pooler.instances` is written as authored**
  (go-kure/launcher#790), a 0 or a negative count included. The Pooler CRD
  gives `instances` a default of 1 and no minimum, and a count of 0 or less
  used to be left out of the Pooler, so the operator ran the one pod the
  author had switched off. The upstream type carries a 0, so it is written;
  the CRD does not bound the count, so a negative one is written too and
  refusing it is left to the cluster. A count that is not authored is still
  3 (`TestPostgresqlRule_PoolerInstances`). Behavior-changing for a document
  with `pooler.instances: 0` or less: its Pooler now holds that count. A
  document with `instances: 0` got one pod before and gets none now (the
  `postgresql-bootstrap-external` fixture shows it).
  **The Pooler's and the Databases' names** (go-kure/launcher#787) are
  resolved in the order of every name role (see "Name roles and the `Naming`
  hook" in `pkg/oam/README.md`): the author's property, else the consumer's
  `Naming` hook, else the default. `poolerName` names the Pooler (role
  `pooler`, default `<name>-pooler`) and must be a DNS-1035 label, since
  CloudNativePG names the pooler's Service after it; it is refused when
  `pooler.enabled` is not true. `databases[].objectName` names that entry's
  Database object (role `database`, default `<name>-<db>`) and must be a
  DNS-1123 subdomain; the entry's `name` stays the database created in
  PostgreSQL. A database whose `name` cannot be part of an object name
  (`app_data`) has no default and needs an `objectName`: without one it is
  refused, and the hook is not asked for it. A name is used as written or
  refused, never shortened. Each is
  also the name of the component the rule emits, so one that is already a
  component of the document, the postgresql component's own name included, is
  refused, naming both; two Databases given one name are refused, naming
  both entries; a Database given the Pooler's name is its sibling, as above.
  The hook is asked only inside `Transform`: a rule driven directly keeps
  the author's names and the defaults. With neither an authored name nor a
  hook the output is what it was.
  **The Cluster's and the ObjectStore's names** (go-kure/launcher#787) are
  resolved in the same order. `clusterObjectName` names the Cluster (role
  `postgresql-cluster`) and `objectStoreObjectName` the ObjectStore (role
  `postgresql-objectstore`); the default of each is the component name. The
  two end in `ObjectName` as `objectName` does on a kind component, while
  `poolerName`, the older property, keeps the name it has.
  `objectStoreObjectName` is refused without `objectStore`
  (`objectStoreObjectName: names the ObjectStore, and objectStore is not
  set; remove it, or set objectStore`), and the hook is not asked for a
  store the component does not generate. The Cluster's name is held to the
  Cluster's rule whoever chose it, a DNS-1035 label of at most 50 characters:
  a name that is no label is refused as every role's is, and a label over 50
  characters by the rule, naming both places it can come from
  (`clusterObjectName (or the Naming hook's answer for role
  "postgresql-cluster"): postgresql Cluster name "…": must be a DNS-1035
  label of at most 50 characters …`). A component whose own name is no such
  label is accepted once its Cluster is named apart. The ObjectStore's name is a
  DNS-1123 subdomain. Each is used as written or refused, never shortened.
  Each names its object alone: the two member components, their same-name
  sibling group, the policies the rule adds and the component label keep the
  component name. What the rule writes to the two objects follows the names
  they took: the Pooler's `cluster.name`, each Database's `cluster.name`, the
  `cnpg.io/cluster` endpoint selector, and the `barmanObjectName` parameter
  of the Cluster's backup plugin. **The default names of the Pooler and the
  Databases keep deriving from the component name** (`<name>-pooler`,
  `<name>-<db>`), whatever the Cluster is named. With the Cluster named
  apart the component name is no longer bounded by the Cluster's rule, so
  the Pooler's default is held to the Pooler's own, by the lowering and where
  endpoints are collected alike, and the refusal says what settles it
  (`pooler: cnpg-pooler name "db.main-pooler": must be a DNS-1035 label of
  at most 63 characters (CloudNativePG names the pooler's Service after it);
  the default derives from the component name: set poolerName to name the
  Pooler otherwise`). A Pooler cannot carry its Cluster's name, and with the
  Cluster named apart the two can meet (a `clusterObjectName` of `db-pooler`
  on component `db`): it is refused where the Pooler is built, and where
  endpoints are collected in the same words (`cluster.name "db-pooler": a
  pooler cannot have the same name as its cluster`). A Pooler or a Database
  named like the `postgresql` component itself (a `poolerName` of `db` on
  component `db`, a database's `objectName`, or the hook's answer) is a name
  the document already holds: it is refused by the lowering, and where
  endpoints are collected in the same words (`pooler: generates component
  "db", which is already the name of component "db" (type "postgresql") in
  the document; rename one of them`). One named like another component of
  the document is refused by the lowering only: endpoints are collected for
  one component (`pkg/oam`, "Name roles and the `Naming` hook").
  **CloudNativePG derives the Cluster's Services (`<cluster>-rw`,
  `<cluster>-ro`, `<cluster>-r`) and Secrets (`<cluster>-app` and the others)
  from the Cluster's name, and the default backup path moves with it: the
  server name a backup is stored under is the Cluster's name unless
  `objectStore.serverName` sets it. Renaming an existing Cluster creates a
  new one: the old one is pruned with its data unless it is protected. Every
  address or Secret reference written with the old name is the author's to
  change.**
  Its rule implements the optional `oam.EndpointProvider`: it declares the CNPG cluster's
  data-plane endpoint (`cnpg.io/cluster: <Cluster name>`, the component name unless the
  Cluster is named apart, on port `5432`) so a downstream
  platform can synthesize the target-side ingress allow (`{comp}-allow-endpoint-ingress`)
  without hardcoding the operator selector. When `pooler.enabled` is set it declares a **second**
  endpoint for the pooler (PgBouncer) pods (`cnpg.io/poolerName: <pooler name>` on port
  `5432`), so a consumer that dials the pooler — whose pods carry a different label set and are not
  matched by the direct-cluster selector — also gets its connection synthesized. The pooler
  name there is the authored `poolerName`, else `<component-name>-pooler`, and the Cluster
  name the authored `clusterObjectName`, else the component name:
  `Transformer.ComponentEndpoints` asks no naming hook. The rule also implements
  `oam.NamedEndpointProvider`, through which `Transformer.ComponentEndpointsNamed` resolves each
  name with the consumer's hook, asked the request the transform asks, so a consumer that
  names the Pooler or the Cluster through the hook gets a selector for the name the object has.
- **cnpg-cluster** — the operator-CR kind component for a CloudNativePG
  `Cluster` (design: `docs/oam/design-operator-cr-components.md`). The
  component name becomes the Cluster's name and its `cnpg.io/cluster`
  endpoint selector, so it must be what CloudNativePG's admission webhook
  admits: a DNS-1035 label (no leading digit, no dot) of at most 50
  characters. Any other name is refused at parse time, when endpoints are
  collected and by `Generate` (`cnpg-cluster name "db.main": must be a
  DNS-1035 label of at most 50 characters …`), although other kinds accept
  DNS-1123 subdomains of up to 253. Its
  properties are the `spec` of a `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1` `Cluster`, one schema
  key per `ClusterSpec` json field: scalars are typed, and every structured
  field is an open `object` or an `array` of open objects whose description
  points at the upstream type. `ToApplicationConfig` decodes the whole property
  map into `cnpgv1.ClusterSpec` with `builtin.DecodeStrictJSON`, so a key the
  linked CNPG version does not declare, at any depth (`storage.sise`,
  `bootstrap.initdb.databse`), and a value of the wrong type
  (`storage.size: 5`) are refused rather than dropped. Two limits come from
  `encoding/json` itself: the unknown-field error names the key but not its
  path, and a key differing from a declared one only in letter case is
  accepted as that field (two spellings of one field in the same object are
  refused, since the decoder would keep only one: `storage.size: sets the
  same field as storage.Size …`). The policy defaults below read what was authored
  from the decoded spec as well as from the property map, where every
  spelling the decoder accepts is consulted, so such a key still counts as
  authored and is not overwritten by a default — including an empty
  `storage.size`, which the decoded spec cannot tell from absence.
  It carries **no launcher opinions**: `Generate` emits the Cluster named after
  the component in the build namespace with exactly the authored spec, so an
  unauthored field is left for the operator's own default. `postgresql`'s
  choices — an image from `version`, `primaryUpdateStrategy: unsupervised`,
  `enablePDB` from the replica count, a `1Gi` storage fallback, pod
  anti-affinity — are not made here: its lowering rule writes them as this
  kind's properties, and the trait it attaches sets the two that depend on
  the policy (see `postgresql`). The one value it writes unasked is
  `instances: 1`, the CRD default, because `ClusterSpec.Instances` has no
  `omitempty` and would otherwise serialize as `0`. The non-pointer blocks
  appear even when unauthored, as they do for `postgresql`: `affinity` and
  `resources` as empty objects, and `postgresql` as
  `syncReplicaElectionConstraint: {enabled: false}`, because that nested
  field's `enabled` has no `omitempty`.
  Nulls follow "The null contract" below, and a null is whatever serializes
  to JSON null: the properties are marshalled with `encoding/json` and read
  back before anything else looks at them, so a null map value is left out
  rather than decoded to an empty string, and a null array element is
  refused by path (`env[0]: null is not a valid array element`). The
  contract covers declared keys only: a key the CNPG type does not declare
  is refused as an unknown field even when its value is null
  (`storage: {sise: null}`), not dropped with the null. A lowering
  rule emits JSON-shaped values (string-keyed maps, slices, scalars) as for
  every component; that is the supported contract, and the engine's schema
  check refuses a typed API struct where it checks an object or array item
  (for example an `env` entry), though not inside an open object's
  undeclared keys. Because the reading is the serialization itself, a
  direct caller of the handler additionally has a value built in Go read
  exactly as `encoding/json` writes it — a concrete collection type, a nil
  behind a pointer, a `json.RawMessage` and a custom encoder included. A
  value that does not serialize is refused. An `instances` below 1, in
  any spelling, is refused before policy runs (`instances: must be >= 1,
  got 0`): the CRD's minimum is 1, so the API server would refuse the
  Cluster. A policy instance-count default below 1 is refused the same way.
  `Generate` repeats the name and instance-count refusals on what it emits,
  the count's upper bound (`instances: must be <= 2147483647, got …`)
  included, so a `CnpgClusterConfig` built in Go without
  `ToApplicationConfig` cannot produce a Cluster the operator or the API
  server rejects for either. It also refuses any storage request the
  Cluster carries that does not parse or is not positive, authored or from
  a policy default, on every claim the storage maximum below covers
  (`storage.size: quantity must be positive, got "0"`;
  `walStorage.pvcTemplate.resources.requests.storage: …`): CloudNativePG's
  webhook parses only `storage.size`, so such a Cluster was admitted and its
  claims then failed the API server's positive storage-request check
  (go-kure/launcher#623). An unset size is still left to the operator.
  An authored `0` or `false` that the typed spec cannot carry, on a field
  whose CRD default is not zero, is refused by path
  (`managed.roles[0].connectionLimit: 0 cannot be carried by the
  CloudNativePG API types (the field is omitted when zero, so the operator
  would apply its default -1)`). These fields are non-pointer and
  `omitempty`, so the value is omitted when the Cluster is encoded and the
  operator applies its CRD default instead. For the linked CNPG version they
  are `managed.roles[].connectionLimit` (default `-1`, unlimited),
  `postgresUID` and `postgresGID` (`26`), `startDelay` (`3600`),
  `stopDelay` (`1800`), `switchoverDelay` (`3600`),
  `probes.liveness.isolationCheck.requestTimeout` and `.connectionTimeout`
  (`1000`) and `replicationSlots.updateInterval` (`30`); a test derives the
  set from the CNPG module's CRD and Go types, so a CNPG bump that changes it
  fails CI. An explicit zero default on any other such field, such as
  `managed.roles[].login: false`, `superuser: false`, `minSyncReplicas: 0`
  or `monitoring.enablePodMonitor: false`, is accepted: it is omitted too,
  and the field's absence means the same value.
  Two fields the Cluster CRD requires, which the Go type leaves out when they
  are empty, are refused when unauthored or empty: the `signerName` and the
  `keyType` of a pod certificate source of the projected volume template
  (`projectedVolumeTemplate.sources[0].podCertificate.signerName: required
  (…)`). The object would show the omission and the API server refuse it.
  Two more that the CRD requires, which the Go type writes as `null` when
  they are unauthored, are refused when unauthored: the `nodeSelectorTerms`
  of a required node affinity
  (`affinity.nodeAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.nodeSelectorTerms:
  required (…)`) and the `databases` of an import
  (`bootstrap.initdb.import.databases: required (…)`). The API server drops a
  null of a field that is not nullable before it validates, so the required
  field is then missing. An authored empty list is written as one and is not
  refused here. A third such field is not refused:
  `replicationSlots.synchronizeReplicas.enabled`, which the CRD defaults, so
  the API server puts the default (`true`) in the place of the null.
  `TestKindComponents_NullRequired` derives the three from the CRD and shows
  each answer by running the CRD's schema validator on the object.
  Eleven strings the CRD requires and bounds, with a minimum length or an
  enumeration, which the Go type writes as `""` when they are unauthored, are
  refused when unauthored, each where its parent is authored
  (`replica.source: required (…)`):
  `backup.barmanObjectStore.destinationPath`,
  `bootstrap.initdb.import.type` (`microservice` or `monolith`),
  `bootstrap.pg_basebackup.source`,
  `externalClusters[].barmanObjectStore.destinationPath`,
  `managed.services.additional[].selectorType` (`rw`, `r` or `ro`),
  `podSelectorRefs[].name`, the `name` of a `postgresql.extensions[]` entry
  and the `name` and the `value` of its `env[]` entries,
  `postgresql.synchronous.method` (`any` or `first`) and `replica.source`.
  The Cluster would carry an empty value the author did not write, and the
  API server refuse it. An authored empty one is a value: it is written, and
  refusing it is left to the API server. The refusal reads the authored
  properties, so `Generate` does not repeat it: a `CnpgClusterConfig` built
  in Go is not held to it. Nor is the component a `postgresql` component is
  lowered to, whose properties are written from a typed spec, so that a
  string left out there reaches the kind as an authored `""`: `postgresql`
  refuses the two it could leave out itself, under the property its author
  wrote (above). The same test
  derives every field
  the type writes unauthored as a zero value the CRD's own rule refuses, and
  shows each answer with the validator; the twelfth of a Cluster is
  `instances`, which is not refused (below).
  `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` derives the two from
  the CRD and shows the refusals. It also holds the two fields the CRD
  defaults and the type writes unauthored to a reason they are harmless:
  `instances`, of which the kind always writes a count (the authored one, the
  policy's default, or the CRD's own `1`), and
  `backup.volumeSnapshot.onlineConfiguration`, written `{}` under an authored
  `volumeSnapshot`. The CRD's default for the object is `waitForArchive: true`
  and `immediateCheckpoint: false`; in a `{}` it fills `waitForArchive` with
  the field's own default `true`, and an absent `immediateCheckpoint` is
  `false`.
  A `false` or `0` the type keeps (a pointer such as `enablePDB: false`,
  a quantity `cpu: 0`) is emitted as authored. An authored
  empty string the type omits on a field the CRD defaults (`primaryUpdateStrategy:
  ""`, `logLevel: ""`) is refused as a defaulted `0` is
  (`cnpgClusterDefaultedZeroFields`); elsewhere it is not refused —
  `storage.size: ""`, which the CRD does not default, keeps its meaning
  above. The two pod-certificate fields above are refused too: an empty
  `signerName` or `keyType` is refused as an unauthored one is.
  A match expression authored in one of the spec's label selectors without
  its `key` or its `operator` is refused by path
  (`podSelectorRefs[0].selector.matchExpressions[0].operator: required (…)`):
  the CRD requires both, and the type would write them empty. Presence only;
  "A label selector's match expressions" lists the selectors and says what is
  left to the API server and to the operator's webhook.
  `ApplyPolicy` enforces the policy `postgresql` enforces (postgresql lowers
  onto this kind, so it is the same code), in this order:
  the instance-count default when `instances` is not authored (an authored
  value wins even when it equals the fallback) and its maximum; the cpu and
  memory request and limit defaults on `resources`, filling only unset
  entries, and their maxima; and the storage-size default on `storage.size`
  when neither `storage.size` nor `storage.pvcTemplate`'s storage request is
  authored. With no policy default the size is left to the operator; the
  `1Gi` fallback is postgresql's, applied after the policy by the post-policy
  step its rule attaches
  (`ApplyPostgresqlDefaults`: the fallback is held to the policy maximum, and
  `enablePDB` is set from the instance count; a fallback over the maximum is the
  component's `oam.ViolationError` of class `oam.RefusalStorageMaximum`, as a
  refusal of `ApplyPolicy` is). That method is for that step,
  not an authoring surface. A storage-size default that is
  not a quantity is refused (`policy default for storage.size: invalid
  quantity "lots"`), as an invalid cpu or memory default is, since with no
  maximum set nothing else would parse it. So is a zero or negative one
  (`quantity must be positive, got "0"`): CloudNativePG's webhook only
  parses the size, and the claims it creates would then fail the API
  server's positive storage-request check. The storage maximum applies to
  every claim the Cluster creates — `storage`, `walStorage`, each
  `tablespaces[i].storage` (either `size` or the `pvcTemplate` request) and
  `ephemeralVolumeSource.volumeClaimTemplate` — and the error names the one
  that exceeds it. Because this kind exposes the two security contexts, it
  also refuses `securityContext.privileged` and a `securityContext` or
  `podSecurityContext` `windowsOptions.hostProcess` unless the policy allows
  privileged workloads, and an added capability the policy forbids or leaves
  off a non-empty allowlist. The registry allowlist the workload kinds apply
  to their image applies to an authored `imageName`
  (`imageName: image "…" is not from an allowed registry [...]`). When
  `imageName` is unset, the operator takes the image from the catalog
  `imageCatalogRef` names, which this kind does not check, or, without one,
  chooses an image of its own, which no allowlist can hold: under a non-empty
  allowlist a Cluster with neither `imageName` nor `imageCatalogRef` is
  refused, with the registry class (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: it
  built before): `imageName: unset, so the CloudNativePG operator chooses the
  image the pods run, which the allowed registries [...] cannot hold; name an
  image from one of them`. Set `imageName`, or `imageCatalogRef` to take the
  image from a catalog. With no allowlist nothing changes. The operator's own
  image, which it runs in the instance pods' bootstrap init container, is not
  covered: no field of the Cluster names it. A `postgresql` component always
  writes `imageName` (its derived `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:<version>` or the authored one),
  so the allowlist applies to its image too. The allowlist applies as well to
  the image of each `postgresql.extensions[]` entry, which the operator mounts
  into the instance pods as an image volume (**breaking**,
  go-kure/launcher#790: an extension image from a registry outside the list
  built before): `postgresql.extensions[0].image.reference: image "…" is not
  from an allowed registry [...]`, with the registry class, the reference read
  as `imageName` is (see *Image volumes* under **pod**). An entry
  without a reference is not checked: the operator takes that image from the
  catalog `imageCatalogRef` names (and refuses the Cluster without one), and
  a catalog's images are not checked by this kind, as for an unset
  `imageName`. A build reads the objects a document brings, not an object a
  reference points at: a catalog's images are held where the catalog is
  authored, by the kind that builds it. `cnpg-imagecatalog` and
  `cnpg-clusterimagecatalog` hold every image of a catalog they build to the
  same list (see their entry above). Nothing in this library holds the images
  of any other catalog: not of a raw catalog on `manifests`, `passthrough` or
  a chart, and not of one that already exists in the cluster. A `postgresql`
  component writes no extension entry. `imageName` and the extension images are every image a
  Cluster names today; the test that walks the pod spec for image fields
  walks the Cluster and the Pooler spec the same way.
  Both are also held to the tag rule (`ValidateImageRef`) when the component
  is read and again at generation, with or without a policy (**breaking**,
  go-kure/launcher#790: an untagged or `:latest` `imageName` or extension
  reference built before): `imageName: image "…" rejected: no tag or digest
  specified; use an explicit version tag or digest`,
  `postgresql.extensions[0].image.reference: image "…" rejected: …`. An unset
  `imageName` and an entry without a reference name no image and are not
  checked, as for the allowlist. A digest without a tag passes, here as
  everywhere the rule runs; on `imageName` CloudNativePG's webhook refuses
  one, and a tag that is no PostgreSQL version, and those are the operator's
  value rules, left to the operator.
  Generation refuses `hugepages-<size>`
  in `resources` without `cpu` or `memory` after policy defaults. It also
  applies the shared parser's request/limit cross-check there
  (`resources: cpu: request 2 must not exceed limit 1`; hugepages and
  extended resources need a limit equal to the request), so a policy default
  limit below an authored request is refused as well. The other
  resource-name rules of the shared parser are left to the API server.
  `Endpoints` declares the same primary endpoint as `postgresql`
  (`cnpg.io/cluster: <Cluster name>` on port `5432`), and only for a
  component the parse accepts: what `ToApplicationConfig` refuses of the
  name or of the properties is refused where endpoints are collected, in the
  same words (`instances: must be >= 1, got 0`). What `Generate` refuses
  once the policy is applied is not repeated there.
  `TestCnpgClusterSchema_CoversClusterSpec` pins the schema to
  `ClusterSpec` by reflection: each json field is published with its type or
  listed with a reason in `cnpgClusterExcludedFields` (empty today), and a
  schema key with no field or a stale exclusion also fails, so a CNPG bump
  that adds, removes or retypes a field names it.
- **cnpg-pooler**, **cnpg-database**, **cnpg-objectstore** — the operator-CR
  kind components for a CloudNativePG `Pooler` and `Database` and a Barman
  Cloud plugin `ObjectStore` (`barmancloud.cnpg.io/v1`), built on the
  `cnpg-cluster` recipe: one schema key per json field of `PoolerSpec`,
  `DatabaseSpec` or `ObjectStoreSpec`, the whole property map decoded strictly
  into that type under the same null contract, the same refusal of an
  authored `0` or `false` the type cannot carry (for the linked versions only
  `instanceSidecarConfiguration.retentionPolicyIntervalSeconds`, default
  `1800`, on the ObjectStore) and of two spellings of one field, and the same
  reflection tests pinning the schema and both derived lists to the linked
  modules. `Generate` emits one object named after the component in the build
  namespace with the authored spec, and repeats the parse-time refusals made
  on the decoded spec. The
  fields each CRD requires are refused when
  unauthored or empty, by path: `cluster.name` and `pgbouncer` on the Pooler
  (`pgbouncer: {}` selects PgBouncer's defaults); `cluster.name`, `name` and
  `owner` on the Database; `configuration.destinationPath` on the ObjectStore.
  The published schema marks the top-level property of each as required
  (go-kure/launcher#790): `cluster` and `pgbouncer` of a `cnpg-pooler`;
  `cluster`, `name` and `owner` of a `cnpg-database`; `configuration` of a
  `cnpg-objectstore`. That refuses no component that built before, since the
  kind refused each without it already.
  A `cluster.name` must be a name CloudNativePG admits for a Cluster (a DNS-1035
  label of at most 50 characters).
  On the Pooler, a match expression authored in a label selector of
  `template.spec` without its `key` or its `operator` is refused too, by
  path; an authored empty one is not (presence only; see "A label selector's
  match expressions").
  `cnpg-pooler` writes no type or instance count of its own, so the operator's
  defaults (`rw`, `1`) apply. Its component name is the Pooler's name and its
  Service's, so it must be a DNS-1035 label of at most 63 characters, and a
  pooler named like its cluster is refused, as CloudNativePG's webhook does:
  by the build, and where its endpoint is collected in the same words
  (`cluster.name "main": a pooler cannot have the same name as its cluster`).
  `ApplyPolicy` applies the workload kinds' pod gates to `template.spec` (host
  namespaces, hostPath volumes, privilege, host-process, capabilities, the
  registry allowlist on each authored container image, cpu and memory maxima;
  errors name the container, as in `template.spec.containers[0] "pgbouncer": cpu
  limit "2" exceeds enforced maximum "1"`), caps a generic ephemeral volume's
  claim at the policy storage maximum, holds an image volume's reference to the
  registry allowlist (`template.spec: volume "ext" image.reference: image "…" is
  not from an allowed registry [...]`; **breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790, see
  *Image volumes* under **pod**), and applies the registry allowlist to an
  authored `pgbouncer.image`. With or without a policy, when the component is
  read and again at generation, an authored `pgbouncer.image`, the image of
  each init and regular container of the template and the reference of each
  of its image volumes are held to the tag rule (`ValidateImageRef`;
  **breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: an untagged or `:latest` one built
  before): `pgbouncer.image: image "…" rejected: …`,
  `template.spec.containers[0] "pgbouncer": image "…" rejected: …`. A template
  container that names no image is not checked: the operator supplies the
  PgBouncer image, so that is the ordinary form here, where the pod kinds
  refuse it. The operator takes the PgBouncer image, in order, from the
  template's regular container named `pgbouncer`, from `pgbouncer.image`, from
  the catalog `pgbouncer.imageCatalogRef` names (not checked by this kind, as
  for `cnpg-cluster`), and otherwise chooses one of its own, which no allowlist
  can hold. Under a non-empty allowlist a Pooler that names its image none of
  these three ways is refused, with the registry class (**breaking**,
  go-kure/launcher#790: it built before): `pgbouncer.image (pooler.image on a
  postgresql component): unset, so the CloudNativePG operator chooses the
  image the pods run, which the allowed registries [...] cannot hold; name an
  image from one of them`. An image on an init container or on a container of
  another name does not count. With no allowlist nothing changes. The
  operator's own image, which it runs in the pod's bootstrap init container,
  is not covered: no field of the Pooler names it. Generation runs the shared
  parser's request/limit and hugepages checks on the template's pod and container
  resources (`template.spec.containers[0] "pgbouncer": resources: cpu: request
  2 must not exceed limit 1`), as `cnpg-cluster` does on its `resources`; the
  other resource-name rules of the shared parser are left to the API server. A
  template declaring `ephemeralContainers`, `activeDeadlineSeconds`, `priority`
  or `overhead` is refused, as the workload kinds refuse them: the operator
  copies the template into a Deployment, whose pod template cannot carry the
  first two and whose pods get the last two from the default Priority and
  RuntimeClass admission controllers, which refuse an authored value that
  differs from theirs. Four fields the Pooler CRD requires under
  `template.spec`, which the pod spec's type leaves out when they are empty,
  are refused when unauthored or empty: the `action` of a restart rule of a
  container or an init container and the `operator` of its exit codes
  (`template.spec.containers[0].restartPolicyRules[0].action: required (…)`),
  and the `signerName` and `keyType` of a pod certificate source of a
  projected volume
  (`template.spec.volumes[0].projected.sources[0].podCertificate.signerName:
  required (…)`). The object would show the omission and the API server
  refuse it; the CRD of the linked module settles that, which is what the
  built-in pod kinds lack.
  `TestKindComponents_OmittedRequiredAndWrittenDefaults` derives the fields
  from the CRD and shows the refusals. Five more that the CRD requires under
  `template.spec`, which the pod spec's type writes as `null` when they are
  unauthored, are refused when unauthored: the `nodeSelectorTerms` of a
  required node affinity, the `priority` of an eviction responder, the
  `monitors` of a `cephfs` or an `rbd` volume, and the `secretRef` of a
  `scaleIO` volume (`template.spec.volumes[0].cephfs.monitors: required (…)`).
  The API server drops a null of a field that is not nullable before it
  validates, so the required field is then missing. An authored empty list is
  written as one and is not refused here. `template.spec.containers` is such
  a field too and is not refused: the kind writes `containers: []` itself
  (below). `TestKindComponents_NullRequired` derives these fields and
  `pgbouncer` from the CRD and shows each answer by running the CRD's schema
  validator on the object. One string the CRD requires and bounds with a
  pattern, which the type writes as `""` when it is unauthored, is refused
  when unauthored under an authored `pgbouncer.imageCatalogRef`: its `key`
  (`pgbouncer.imageCatalogRef.key: required (…)`). An authored empty one is
  written, and refusing it is left to the API server. The refusal reads the
  authored properties, so `Generate` does not repeat it: a `CnpgPoolerConfig`
  built in Go is not held to it. The same test derives
  it, as the one field of a Pooler the type writes unauthored as a zero value
  the CRD's own rule refuses. The instance count is deliberately not policed:
  `postgresql`, which lowers its pooler onto this kind, never applied a
  policy to the pooler's count, so a maximum here would refuse a document
  that built before.
  Pod-level errors name the template's own fields, as in `template.spec:
  resources cpu limit "2" exceeds enforced maximum "1"`. A `template` that lists
  no containers (labels only, say) is written with `containers: []`: the Go type
  cannot omit the template's `spec`, the CRD requires `containers` once it is
  present, and the operator adds its `pgbouncer` container either way.
  `Endpoints` declares the PgBouncer pods (`cnpg.io/poolerName:
  <Pooler object name>` on port `5432`: the component name unless
  `objectName` or the naming hook names the Pooler), byte-identical to `postgresql`'s pooler
  endpoint for a pooler of that name (`<component-name>-pooler` by default,
  of the `postgresql` component), and
  only for a component the parse accepts: what `ToApplicationConfig` refuses
  is refused where endpoints are collected, in the same words (`pgbouncer:
  required (an empty object selects PgBouncer's defaults)`).
  `cnpg-database` also refuses the names the CRD reserves (`postgres`,
  `template0`, `template1`). The `ensure` of each schema, extension, fdw and
  server has no `omitempty` but a CRD default of `present`, so `Generate` writes
  `present` where it is unauthored, as the API server would have; a
  test derives that list from the CRD too. An authored `ensure: ""` there is
  refused by its path (`schemas[0].ensure: "" is refused by the Database CRD,
  …`) rather than written as `present`, since the CRD's enum refuses it as
  written; an explicit null is absence and takes the default. A Database runs nothing, so it has
  no policy and no endpoint.
  `cnpg-objectstore` caps the cpu and memory requests and limits of the plugin
  sidecar it adds to every instance pod (`instanceSidecarConfiguration.resources`)
  at the policy maxima, filling no default, and declares no endpoint;
  generation runs the same request/limit and hugepages checks on them, leaving
  the other resource-name rules to the API server. It refuses
  `configuration.serverName`, which the shared Barman type carries but the
  plugin's CRD forbids on an ObjectStore: the server name is a plugin parameter
  of the Cluster that uses the store.
- **passthrough** — `object` (full apiVersion/kind/metadata/spec), `clusterScoped`.
  Its config exposes `ComponentName() string` (the `oam.ComponentNamed` interface) so
  consumers can attribute the emitted resource to its owning OAM component.
  **`object` must be a single object; a list is rejected.** `Generate` emits the map
  verbatim as one resource and fills in metadata it finds missing: `metadata.name`
  defaults to the component name when it is absent, empty, **or not a string**, and
  on a namespaced object `metadata.namespace` likewise — so an inline *non-empty
  string* namespace survives untouched, while a non-string one is replaced rather
  than emitted.

  **Scope** (go-kure/launcher#794, item 13). Whether the object is namespaced is
  resolved with the precedence `manifests` gives a `scopeOverrides` entry,
  with `clusterScoped` in the entry's place (`resolveClusterScoped`,
  `passthrough.go`):

  - **A kind whose scope the Kubernetes API governs** (a built-in kind, a
    `CustomResourceDefinition`; `isAPIGovernedScope`): kure's scope table decides. A
    `PriorityClass`, a `ClusterRole` or a `Namespace` gets no namespace without the
    property. A `clusterScoped` that contradicts the table is refused: `true` on a
    namespaced built-in, an explicit `false` on a cluster-scoped one (`passthrough
    component "batch-low": clusterScoped is false, but the Kubernetes API defines
    scheduling.k8s.io/v1 PriorityClass as cluster-scoped; remove clusterScoped`).
    **This is the one difference from `manifests`**, which ignores a `scopeOverrides`
    entry for such a kind: its list may name kinds the source does not hold, while
    `clusterScoped` is a statement about the one object, so a wrong one is an error
    in the document and not a spare entry.
  - **Any other kind:** an authored `clusterScoped` decides, `true` or `false`, also
    against the table. A custom resource kure registers as cluster-scoped that the
    target cluster serves namespaced takes `clusterScoped: false`.
  - **Not authored** (absent or `null`): the table decides for a kind kure registers,
    so a cert-manager `ClusterIssuer` gets no namespace. A kind nothing knows is
    treated as namespaced, the default this component always had. `manifests` fails
    closed on an unknown scope; `passthrough` does not, since every custom resource
    passed through without the property relies on that default.

  No `CustomResourceDefinition` is consulted: the component holds one object. A
  cluster-scoped object, however it was resolved, gets no namespace default, and an
  inline namespace on it is refused with the reason named (`passthrough component
  "ca": object.metadata.namespace must not be set ("other"): cert-manager.io/v1
  ClusterIssuer is registered as cluster-scoped (set clusterScoped: false if the
  cluster serves it namespaced); the Kubernetes API rejects a namespace on a
  cluster-scoped object`). That rejection is keyed on a non-empty string, so a
  non-string `namespace` on a cluster-scoped object is neither rejected nor
  defaulted and reaches the output as authored. The resolution runs in `Generate`
  too, on the object about to be emitted, so a `PassthroughConfig` built directly is
  held to it; its `ClusterScoped` field states `true` or nothing, since an explicit
  `false` exists only for an authored property.

  **Breaking** (pre-GA): an object of a cluster-scoped kind the table knows loses the
  application namespace it was stamped with when `clusterScoped` was not set;
  `clusterScoped: true` on a built-in namespaced kind and `clusterScoped: false` on a
  built-in cluster-scoped kind stop building; and an inline namespace on a
  cluster-scoped kind the table knows is refused without the property too, where it
  was emitted as authored.

  **Lists.** `Generate` emits the map as one resource, so a list would arrive
  downstream as one *named*
  envelope whose `items` never see per-object label mutation, namespace stamping or
  ownership checks — while Flux unwraps it at apply time into N objects that
  do reach the cluster. One envelope bypasses every per-object rule at once, which is why
  the rejection lives here and not in each consumer. Declare one component per object.
  The check is apimachinery's own `Unstructured.IsList` — `items` present **and** a
  sequence — never the kind name, so a typed `ConfigMapList` is caught and a CRD whose
  kind merely *ends* in `List` with no `items` still compiles.

  This arm is **deliberately stricter than Kustomize** for a kind that does *not* end in
  `List` but carries a top-level `items` array, such as `{kind: Widget, items: [...]}`.
  Kustomize's build keeps that as one resource, because it consults `items` only on a
  `List`-suffixed kind. Flux's kustomize-controller then decodes the build output with
  the same `IsList` predicate and no kind check, and applies the array's members *instead
  of* the object: a `Widget` whose `items` holds a `ConfigMap` puts that `ConfigMap` on
  the cluster, in whatever namespace it names, and never applies the `Widget`. With
  scalar members the Flux apply fails outright. Either way it is not one object, so it is
  rejected.

  A second arm catches what `IsList` structurally cannot. It requires `items` to be
  exactly a `[]interface{}`, so an authored `items: null` — an untyped nil — passed
  every check and then expanded to **zero** objects at apply time with no error at
  all; with pruning enabled an empty desired result also removes whatever the previous
  inventory held. That case is rejected on its own diagnostic ("expands to zero
  objects"), and it is keyed on a **null** `items` **on a kind ending in `List`**
  rather than a present one — a CRD may legitimately carry an object-valued `items`
  field that must keep compiling, and an ordinary, non-`List` kind may equally carry
  a null-valued `items` field (a plausible spec-field collision) without being an
  envelope at all. Matches Kustomize's own `inlineAnyEmbeddedLists`, which checks the
  kind suffix before ever consulting `items`; Flux agrees, since a null `items` is not
  a list to `IsList` and the object is applied as one.

  The validated object is deep-copied when the config is built, not aliased, so a
  caller that keeps mutating the map it passed in cannot change what was validated.
  The copy detaches nested maps and slices whatever their concrete type — the authored
  path only ever yields `map[string]any` and `[]any`, but a Go-assembled body can hold
  a `map[string]string` or a `[]string`, and those used to alias straight through. A
  null survives as a null rather than becoming an empty `{}`/`[]`. Two things it
  deliberately does not do: it does not chase pointers (a `*Location` inside a
  `time.Time`, `resource.Quantity`'s `*inf.Dec`), and it does not reject the shapes it
  cannot fully detach.

  The copy is **not** what makes the rejection binding, and this section used to claim
  it was. `Object` is an exported field, so a caller holding the config can assign a
  fresh map over it, and a struct literal or a JSON decode never runs
  `ToApplicationConfig` at all — three routes reaching `Generate` with a body the arms
  never saw. `Generate` therefore re-runs, on the map it is about to emit, every check
  that must hold of an emitted body: a non-empty `apiVersion` and `kind`, and both list
  arms. Checking the bytes being emitted, rather than trusting a check that ran on some
  earlier map, is what closes those routes.

  Those checks live in one function precisely so the two call sites cannot disagree
  about what a valid body is. While they were split — the constructor checking identity,
  `Generate` checking only list shape — a `PassthroughConfig` holding an *empty* map
  passed both: non-nil, so it cleared the no-object guard, and carrying no `items`, so
  it cleared both arms, leaving `Generate` to emit a document consisting of nothing but
  the metadata it had just stamped on.

  **Policy.** `ApplyPolicy` holds the object to the environment policy
  (go-kure/launcher#794), with the check template delivery runs on the objects a chart
  renders (`helmtemplate`'s *Every emitted workload*); the transform calls it with
  `NoopPolicy` when no policy is passed. A Pod, PodTemplate, ReplicationController,
  Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Job or CronJob is checked as an authored
  workload is: host namespaces, hostPath volumes, the cpu/memory maxima, the storage
  maximum on a generic ephemeral volume's claim, the registry allowlist on an image
  volume's reference (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: an object with one from a
  registry outside the list built before; see *Image volumes* under **pod**), and
  for every init and regular container
  the registry allowlist, the privileged, HostProcess and capability gates, and
  `ValidateImageRef` (no untagged image, no `:latest`), which holds the reference of an
  image volume too (**breaking**, go-kure/launcher#790: an object with an untagged or
  `:latest` one built before). Ephemeral containers are refused.
  The storage a PersistentVolumeClaim, or a StatefulSet's claim template, requests is held
  to the storage maximum (`MaxStorageSize`); the replica count of a Deployment,
  StatefulSet, ReplicaSet or ReplicationController (one when the object sets none) and the
  `maxReplicas` of a HorizontalPodAutoscaler, in any API version, to the replica maximum
  (`MaxReplicas`). A PersistentVolume is held to what the `persistentvolume` kind holds
  its own to: a `hostPath` or `local` source needs `AllowHostPathVolumes()`, and
  `spec.capacity.storage` is held to the storage maximum (breaking for a document that
  holds one; see **persistentvolume**). The error is the component's policy violation and names the object and
  the field (`passthrough: object Deployment "demo/web":
  spec.template.spec.containers[0] "app": …`).

  A core Secret is refused under a policy that forbids explicit secrets
  (`oam.ExplicitSecretPolicy`, see the `pkg/oam` README), as the `secret` trait is
  (go-kure/launcher#794, item 2): `passthrough: object Secret "demo/creds": the object is a
  Secret, and the environment policy forbids explicit secrets; …`. The check does not read
  what the Secret holds, so one with no entry is refused too, and the message quotes nothing
  of the object. A policy that does not implement the interface, and no policy, allow it.
  **Breaking** only under a policy that answers `false`: a `passthrough` Secret built under
  it before.

  The object is authored as a map and the check reads Go types, so an object whose group,
  version and kind kure's scheme registers is decoded as that kind **for the check only**.
  What is emitted stays the authored map, so a field the Go type does not declare is
  emitted with it, and a large integer is emitted as authored, which kure's manifest writer
  writes with its own digits (`helmtemplate`'s *Rendered objects*). The check
  cannot read such a field, so a workload or a claim that sets one is refused, as template
  delivery and `manifests` refuse it (`helmtemplate`'s *Undeclared fields*): when the
  component is built and again by `Generate`, under any policy and with none
  (`passthrough component "web": object Deployment "demo/web": undeclared field
  spec.template.spec.fieldOfALaterVersion: …`). A workload or a claim in which a value
  that serializes itself (a Go caller's `json.RawMessage`) repeats enough keys to fill the
  strict decode's record is refused on the same ground. An object of any other kind is
  emitted as authored, the field with it, whatever the strict decode says of it: nothing
  it sets is dropped, so the full-record refusal of `manifests` has no part here.
  **Breaking** (go-kure/launcher#794, item 7): a workload or claim with an
  undeclared field was emitted unchecked before and no longer builds.
  `Generate` runs the check again on the object it is about to emit, once
  `ApplyPolicy` has supplied a policy, because `Object` is an exported field and the map
  checked need not be the map emitted; a refusal there is the same
  `*oam.ViolationError`, naming the component.

  What cannot be read is refused, not passed: an object of a registered kind that does not
  decode as that kind (`replicas: three`), a workload kind, a claim or a PersistentVolume
  in an API version the scheme does not register (`batch/v1beta1`, `apps/v1beta2`), a
  HorizontalPodAutoscaler in such a
  version whose `maxReplicas` is not an integer, and an object that does not serialize.
  So is an object the decoder of its kind panics on, which crashed the build before: a
  `CiliumNetworkPolicy` or `CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy` whose `icmps` field leaves its
  `type` out, for one (`passthrough: object CiliumNetworkPolicy "demo/p": the object cannot
  be read, …: the decoder panicked on CiliumNetworkPolicy "demo/p": …`, the parse error kure
  gives such an object since go-kure/kure#1009). A MetalLB `BGPPeer` at `metallb.io/v1beta2`
  is a registered kind since go-kure/kure#1007, so one that does not decode as that kind
  (`holdTime: [1]`) is refused here too; it was emitted unread. Since go-kure/kure#1014 an
  object of a registered kind that states `Kind` or `apiversion` beside the exact key is
  refused here as well, with the parser's text for the cause (`the key "Kind" equals "kind"
  only after case folding; …`). **Breaking**: the `Kind` case was read as its Go type and
  checked, and so was the `apiversion` case where that key states a version the kind is
  registered in (`apiversion: v1` beside `apiVersion: v1`); with another version there it
  was unreadable before, for another cause. Every build
  decodes the object, since the transform applies `NoopPolicy` when no policy is passed;
  only a config no policy was applied to, one a Go caller builds
  outside the transform, emits the object undecoded, as authored.

  **Behaviour change:** before go-kure/launcher#794 a `passthrough` object reached the
  output unchecked. A document that relied on that no longer builds when its object is a
  workload with a privileged container, a host namespace, a hostPath volume, an image
  outside the registry allowlist, an untagged or `:latest` image, or a value over a
  maximum — and with no policy passed the first three are always refused, since
  `NoopPolicy` denies them. A consumer allows what it wants allowed through its policy,
  not per component: `AllowPrivileged()`, `AllowHostNetwork()`, `AllowHostPID()`,
  `AllowHostIPC()` and `AllowHostPathVolumes()` for the security flags, the registry in
  `AllowedRegistries()` (or no allowlist), the capability lists, and the maxima
  (`MaxReplicas()`, `MaxCPU()`, `MaxMemory()`, `MaxStorageSize()`). An untagged or
  `:latest` image has to be pinned in the object, and a workload in an API version the
  build cannot read has to be authored in the one it can (`batch/v1`, `apps/v1`).

  Not checked: an object of a kind not named above; a custom resource, the pods its controller
  creates and the replica count it sets; what a `Secret` holds (a core Secret is told by its
  group and kind alone, and refused only under a policy that forbids explicit secrets). A nil
  policy (a direct `ApplyPolicy(nil)`, or `Generate` on a config no policy was applied
  to) checks nothing, and `ApplyPolicy(nil)` withdraws no policy applied before.
- **crd / manifests** — `inline` xor `url`; `manifests` adds `scopeOverrides`
  (`apiVersion`/`kind`/`scope`), the author's explicit statement of a kind's scope.
  An override outranks kure's own non-API-governed scope-table entry — a kind
  nothing else can scope, e.g. a cluster-scoped custom resource whose CRD is
  installed out of band. It does **not** outrank a `CustomResourceDefinition`
  bundled in the same source: that CRD is the definition being applied, so it
  must agree with the override rather than be overridden by it — a disagreement
  is rejected (`manifests.go`'s `stampManifestNamespaces`, an error naming both
  the override's and the CRD's declared scope; the resolution itself is
  `resolveObjectScope`, which the `helmtemplate` component's `scopeOverrides`
  goes through too); an agreeing override still
  applies, and a kind with no same-source CRD falls back to the non-API-governed
  case above. It is also ignored
  for a kind the Kubernetes API itself governs (`isAPIGovernedScope`,
  `manifests.go`: a `CustomResourceDefinition` document; any kind whose kure
  scope-table entry comes from `ScopeSourceBuiltin` — i.e. from the generated
  upstream types, `PriorityClass`, `APIService` and the two webhook
  configurations among them; and any cluster-scoped API built-in kure fixes the
  scope of without registering it, a set that is empty at the kure version in
  `go.mod`. Such a kind is detected by
  asking `manifest.Scope` itself with no CRD context, not by copying kure's
  list, so kure stays the single answer); a manifest cannot redefine those. A kind with no override and
  no other scope source still fails closed when it carries no
  `metadata.namespace`. Conversely, a cluster-scoped object (either component,
  any scope source) that authors `metadata.namespace` is rejected rather than
  emitted as-is — the Kubernetes API forbids a namespace on a cluster-scoped
  object, so letting it through would only defer the failure to apply time.
  Both components decode a document of a registered kind into its Go type, with the
  decode `helmtemplate` gives a rendered chart, and treat a field that type does not
  declare — one a newer Kubernetes version added, say — as it does (`helmtemplate`'s
  *Undeclared fields*): a workload or a claim that sets one is refused, under any policy
  and with none (`manifest source: parse manifests: Deployment "demo/web": undeclared
  field spec.template.spec.fieldOfALaterVersion: …`), an inline source when the component
  is built and a url source when it is fetched; an object of any other registered kind is
  emitted as written, unstructured, the field kept, and a `CustomResourceDefinition` kept
  so still passes `crd` and still gives its scope to the resources beside it. **Breaking**
  (go-kure/launcher#794, item 7), in the same two ways: a source with such a workload or
  claim no longer builds, and the output of other kinds gains the fields that had been
  dropped. The same known limit applies (a key inside a type that unmarshals itself, a
  CRD's `items` schema for one, is still dropped). A document the decoder of its kind
  panics on is a build error naming the object, as it is there (`manifest source: parse
  manifests: parse error in Kubernetes object: failed to decode object: the decoder
  panicked on CiliumNetworkPolicy "demo/p": …`), and so is malformed JSON the decoder
  cannot read past, on which the build did not return before go-kure/kure#1012. A MetalLB
  `BGPPeer` at `metallb.io/v1beta2` is a registered kind since go-kure/kure#1007 and is
  read as one, with what that changes (`helmtemplate`'s *Rendered objects*).
  An integer the object holds as one is written with its own digits, here as everywhere
  (`9007199254740993` as `9007199254740993`; `helmtemplate`'s *Rendered objects*). In an
  unstructured object an integer an int64 cannot hold is a float from the decode on, and is
  written as that float.

  **Policy.** Every object a `manifests` or `crd` source yields is checked against the
  environment policy with the check template delivery (`helmtemplate`) and `passthrough`
  use: each Pod, PodTemplate, ReplicationController, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet,
  ReplicaSet, Job and CronJob is checked as an authored workload is (host namespaces,
  hostPath volumes, the cpu/memory maxima, the registry allowlist on every init and
  regular container's image and on an image volume's reference, the privileged,
  HostProcess and capability gates, `ValidateImageRef` on both, no ephemeral containers), a
  PersistentVolumeClaim and a StatefulSet's claim template are held to the storage
  maximum, and a replica count and a HorizontalPodAutoscaler's `maxReplicas` to the
  replica maximum. A PersistentVolume is held to what the `persistentvolume` kind holds
  its own to: a `hostPath` or `local` source needs `AllowHostPathVolumes()`, and
  `spec.capacity.storage` is held to the storage maximum (breaking for a source that
  holds one; see **persistentvolume**). An image volume from a registry outside
  the list is refused since go-kure/launcher#790 (**breaking** for a source that holds
  one; see *Image volumes* under **pod**). The error names the object and the field (`manifest source: object
  Deployment "demo/web": spec.template.spec.containers[0] "app": …`). A `crd` source
  holds only CustomResourceDefinitions, none of which the check reads, so `crd` builds as
  before.

  A core Secret a `manifests` source yields, `inline` or fetched, is refused under a policy
  that forbids explicit secrets (`oam.ExplicitSecretPolicy`), as the `secret` trait and a
  `passthrough` Secret are (go-kure/launcher#794, item 10): `manifest source: object Secret
  "demo/creds": the object is a Secret, and the environment policy forbids explicit
  secrets; …`. The check does not read what the Secret holds, and the message quotes
  nothing of it. **Breaking** only under a policy that answers `false`. **Not covered:** a
  Secret a chart renders under template delivery (`helmtemplate`, `helm` with
  `delivery: template`), whose content comes from the chart and its values; the document's
  own sensitive values are refused there where they are set (`secretValues`).

  When the check runs depends on the source. An `inline` source is checked by
  `ApplyPolicy`, the transform's policy step, and the refusal is that step's
  `*oam.ViolationError`. A `url` source is checked in `Generate`, on the objects it is
  about to emit: `ApplyPolicy` checks its host against the allowed registries and does
  not fetch, so **a caller that runs the transform and never generates does not see an
  object refusal for a `url` source**. A refusal in `Generate` is the same
  `*oam.ViolationError`, naming the component; a fetch or parse failure there keeps its
  own error and is not a policy violation. `Generate` also checks an `inline` source
  again, on what it emits.

  What cannot be read is refused, not passed: a workload, claim or PersistentVolume in
  an API version kure's scheme does not register (`batch/v1beta1`, `apps/v1beta2`),
  inside a list as outside one. A list is replaced by its items, each decoded and checked
  as a document of its own is, for a field its type does not declare too (`manifest
  source: parse manifests: item 0 of List: Deployment "demo/web": undeclared field …`):
  a `v1` `List`, a typed list (`DeploymentList`) and, since go-kure/kure#1014, a list of
  a kind the scheme does not register (a kind ending in `List` that states `items`),
  whose items of a registered kind are their Go types and are checked for real, a list
  among them opened in turn. The list handling is the one `helmtemplate`'s *Rendered
  objects* describes, with the same errors under `manifest source: parse manifests: …`:
  a label or an annotation on a list's own metadata, a `Kind`, `apiversion` or `Items`
  key, a `null` item, and an object of a kind that is no list with a top-level `items`
  array, which is refused with a policy or with none and is no policy violation.
  **Breaking** (go-kure/launcher#790): the table under `helmtemplate` lists what built
  before and is refused now.

  **Behaviour change:** before go-kure/launcher#794 the objects of a `manifests` source
  reached the output unchecked. A document that relied on that no longer builds when its
  source holds a workload with a privileged container, a host namespace, a hostPath
  volume, an image outside the registry allowlist, an untagged or `:latest` image, or a
  value over a maximum, or an object the check cannot read (above) — and with no policy
  passed the first three are always refused, since `NoopPolicy` denies them. A consumer
  allows what it wants allowed through its policy, not per component, exactly as for
  `passthrough`. An untagged or `:latest` image has to be pinned in the source,
  and a workload in an API version the build cannot read has to be authored in the one
  it can (`batch/v1`, `apps/v1`).

  Not checked: an object of a kind not named above; a custom resource, the pods its controller
  creates and the replica count it sets; what a `Secret` holds (a core Secret is told by its
  group and kind alone, and refused only under a policy that forbids explicit secrets). A nil
  policy (a direct `ApplyPolicy(nil)`, or `Generate` on a config no policy was applied
  to) checks nothing, and `ApplyPolicy(nil)` withdraws no policy applied before.

  A `url` that does not parse is refused without the URL or the parser's
  error, and a fetch error names the URL by scheme and host only
  (`manifestsource.go`'s `displayURL`; a URL with no host is not named): its
  userinfo, path or query may carry a credential, and an IPv6 zone in the host is
  dropped too. A refused redirect hop reads fixed text (`redirect to a url that is
  not http(s) refused`, `redirect to a host not in allowed registries refused`,
  `too many redirects`), since its target is the server's. A failed request or body read is
  named by fixed text only (`failureCause`): a timeout, a failed host lookup,
  or the failing network operation and its system error, such as
  `dial failed: connection refused`; anything else reads `request failed` or
  `response body could not be read`. The underlying error's own text is never
  shown, since it can quote the URL, a server-sent header or trailer, or a TLS
  certificate, but it stays the error's cause: `errors.Is` and `errors.As` still
  find it, so a timeout matches `context.DeadlineExceeded`.

## StatefulSet-level and claim-template properties

The `statefulset` kind projects the whole `appsv1.StatefulSetSpec` field set it
owns, and each `volumeClaimTemplates` entry projects the whole
`corev1.PersistentVolumeClaimSpec`. Every field below is written only when
authored, so an unauthored StatefulSet emits no `podManagementPolicy` at all and
an empty `updateStrategy: {}` (a non-pointer struct, which `omitempty` does not
suppress), leaving the apiserver to default both. Until go-kure/launcher#361
kure's `CreateStatefulSet` wrote `podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady` into the
object itself; the release-1 builder contract makes that constructor
identity-only, so the line is gone from the emitted manifest. The *effective*
policy is unchanged — `OrderedReady` is also the API default — but the manifest
text moved, which is why three goldens lost a `podManagementPolicy:
OrderedReady` line. The claim entry's five
pre-existing keys (`name`, `mountPath`, `size`, `storageClass`, `accessModes`)
now sit inside a closed key set, so a typo in an entry is reported instead of
being silently dropped. `devicePath` joined that set with go-kure/launcher#385.

Columns match the pod-level table above: **additive** means no document that
built before builds differently now; **behavior-changing** means an existing
document's meaning or acceptance moved.

| Property | Type | Effect | Kind |
|----------|------|--------|------|
| `podManagementPolicy` | enum | `OrderedReady` (also the apiserver's default for an unauthored StatefulSet, so authoring it is a no-op that only pins the value in the manifest) or `Parallel`. | additive |
| `updateStrategy{type, rollingUpdate{partition, maxUnavailable}}` | object | `type` is `RollingUpdate` or `OnDelete`; `rollingUpdate` is rejected under `OnDelete`, mirroring `ValidateStatefulSetSpec`. `type` is required only for an otherwise empty `updateStrategy: {}`, whose whole meaning would come from apiserver defaulting; when `rollingUpdate` is authored, `RollingUpdate` is inferred, since it is both the API default and the only type that reads the field. `partition` is `>= 0`. `maxUnavailable` takes a positive integer or a 1–100% string; the schema leaf is the `Types: [integer, string]` union (go-kure/launcher#383), so a schema-validating consumer accepts both forms. | additive |
| `revisionHistoryLimit` | int ≥ 0 | Retained controller revisions. | additive |
| `minReadySeconds` | int ≥ 0 | Readiness settling time before a pod counts as available. | additive |
| `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy{whenDeleted, whenScaled}` | object | Each is `Retain` or `Delete`. | additive |
| `ordinals{start}` | object | `start` shifts the replica ordinal range and is required once `ordinals` is authored; `>= 0`. | additive |
| `selector` (claim) | object | `matchLabels`/`matchExpressions`, with the operator arity rule — `In`/`NotIn` need at least one value, `Exists`/`DoesNotExist` none — and every `values` entry validated as a label value, the check `ValidateLabelSelectorRequirement` runs on a newly created claim template. An entirely empty `selector` is rejected: the apiserver would accept it as matching every volume, which is never what an author who wrote the key meant. **Authoring a selector opts the claim out of dynamic provisioning**: a claim with a non-empty selector is never provisioned from its `StorageClass` and stays `Pending` until a pre-provisioned PV matches ([Kubernetes: persistent volumes — Selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#selector)). | additive |
| `resources{requests,limits}` (claim) | object | `storage` is the only accepted resource name — `ValidatePersistentVolumeClaimSpec` reads `requests[storage]` and nothing else, so any other name would be silently ignored. Quantities must be positive. `apply` *merges* `requests` onto the claim-template literal `createStatefulSet` already built (`statefulset.go`, which writes `requests.storage` from `size`), so `size` survives when only `limits` is authored. `requests.storage` is the long spelling of `size`; authoring both is an error. | additive |
| `volumeMode` (claim) | enum | `Filesystem` or `Block`. `Filesystem` pairs with `mountPath`; `Block` pairs with `devicePath` and renders a main-container `volumeDevices` entry instead of a `volumeMount` (go-kure/launcher#385, see "Raw block volumes"). Until then `Block` was rejected, because every claim was mounted as a filesystem and the apiserver would have accepted the mismatched claim/pod pair. | additive |
| `devicePath` (claim) | string | Where a `volumeMode: Block` claim appears in the main container as a raw block device. Not a claim-spec field. Exactly one of `mountPath` and `devicePath` is required, and `devicePath` only with `volumeMode: Block`. | additive |
| `dataSourceRef{apiGroup,kind,name,namespace}` (claim) | object | Mirrors upstream `validateDataSourceRef`: `kind` and `name` are required non-empty with no format rule (a Kind is a CamelCase identifier, not a DNS name), `apiGroup` must be a DNS-1123 subdomain when non-empty, an omitted or empty `apiGroup` pins `kind` to `PersistentVolumeClaim` (the core group holds no other populator), and `namespace`, when set, is a DNS-1123 *label* (`ValidateNamespaceName`), not a subdomain. | additive |
| `volumeAttributesClassName` (claim) | string | DNS-1123 subdomain naming a `VolumeAttributesClass`. | additive |
| `storageClass` (claim) | string | **Behavior-changing.** A non-empty value is now validated as a DNS-1123 subdomain (`ValidateClassName`, the check `ValidatePersistentVolumeClaimSpec` runs and the one the `volumes[].pvc` path already applied). An invalid class name previously built a claim and was refused later by the apiserver; it is now refused here. A present-but-non-string value is likewise rejected rather than read as absent and provisioned through the cluster default class. | behavior-changing |
| `storageClass` (claim) — `""` and the `pvc` capability | string | **Pre-GA output change** (go-kure/launcher#761). An authored `storageClass: ""` now requests no class: the claim template carries `storageClassName: ""`, as a `volumes[].pvc` claim and the `persistentvolumeclaim` kind do. It used to read as absent, so the template carried no class and the cluster's default applied. An unauthored entry (absent or `null`) now takes the ClusterProfile `pvc` capability's `storageClassName`, as an authored `pvc` trait does: the handler implements `ComponentCapabilityFiller`, reads the binding through `LoweringContext.Capability` once the component has an entry, so `pvc` is in `ConsumedCapabilities` exactly then, and fills each unauthored entry. An authored class, `""` included, wins; a non-string rendering value is refused. Either change alters an existing StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplates`, which the apiserver refuses to update: the StatefulSet fails to apply until it is recreated (the `force-replace` trait recreates it on apply, restarting its pods). The claims it already made keep their class, unless the retention policy deletes them with it. | behavior-changing |
| `size` (claim) | quantity | **Behavior-changing.** `size` is now the short spelling of `resources.requests.storage` rather than a key of its own, and it is no longer unconditionally required — either spelling satisfies the requirement, and authoring both is an error. It must also now be **positive**: `0` was accepted before and is rejected now, matching upstream's `ValidatePositiveQuantityValue` on `requests[storage]`. (The `volumes[].pvc.size` surface on every kind applies the same positivity rule since go-kure/launcher#384.) Because "authored" is now read through `parseStringField`, an explicitly empty `size: ""` no longer counts as authoring the short spelling, so pairing it with `resources.requests.storage` is accepted rather than rejected as a double spelling. | behavior-changing |
| any unrecognized key on a claim entry | — | **Behavior-changing.** A `volumeClaimTemplates` entry is now a closed key set. The previous parser called no `rejectUnknownKeys` at all on the entry map, so a misspelled `storageClassName` was dropped and the claim was provisioned through the cluster default class with nothing said. Such a document built before and errors now, which is a break of the additive test in `docs/oam/design-gvk.md` under an unchanged `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1`. It is taken deliberately and on precedent: `6aed090` (`feat(format): enforce policy and support securityContext on init/sidecar containers`) shipped the same tightening on init/sidecar container entries. The `format` commit scope is what signals it — `cliff.toml` groups those commits under a **Document Format** changelog heading. | behavior-changing |
| any optional field above, authored as null | — | **Not a wrong type — absence.** Every optional StatefulSet-level and claim-level field added here reads an explicit null as omission, so `updateStrategy:` with nothing after it builds exactly as omitting the key does. This matters beyond hand-written YAML: a lowering rule may emit a nil, `pkg/oam`'s emission validation accepts it ("a nil under an optional field constrains nothing"), and a parser that answered "must be an object, got `<nil>`" would let a component satisfy the published schema and then fail conversion. Where the null lands on a field that is *required* once its parent is authored (`ordinals.start`, a claim's `name`), it surfaces as the requiredness error, never as a type error. This covers the optional lists as well as the scalars and objects (`selector.matchExpressions`, a match expression's `values`), and it covers a **typed** nil — `map[string]any(nil)` or `[]any(nil)` inside an `any`, which is what a lowering rule assembled in Go produces for an unset optional and is not `== nil` — because `pkg/oam`'s `isNullValue` classifies those as null too. A key the schema rejects outright is unaffected: authoring it as null still earns the explanatory refusal rather than silence. go-kure/launcher#394 extended the same treatment to the shared field helpers and to the parsers it converted, so it reaches well beyond these fields — but not the whole package. The lifecycle and probe handler keys, where presence itself is the rule being enforced, refuse a null; since go-kure/launcher#570 a container's resource quantities under any name and the top-level keys once read with a bare lookup (listed with the `null` row of the `deployment` table above) read it as omission. | additive |
| `volumeClaimTemplates` itself — wrong type | list | **Behavior-changing.** The previous parser answered "is it present" and "is it a list" with one type assertion, so `volumeClaimTemplates: {name: data}` or a stray scalar was indistinguishable from an absent key: the StatefulSet was built with no claim templates and nothing was reported. A present-but-non-list value is now rejected naming the type received. **An explicit null is absence, not a wrong type** — `volumeClaimTemplates:` with no value decodes to nil, the key is optional in the schema, and `pkg/oam`'s own requiredness check (`isNullValue`) already reads nil as absent, so a document written that way is valid `launcher.gokure.dev/v1alpha1` today and keeps building. | behavior-changing |
| `name`, `mountPath` (claim) — collisions | string | **Behavior-changing.** A claim template's `name` must differ from every other claim template's and every `volumes` entry's, and its `mountPath` from every other main-container `mountPath`, claim templates and `volumes` together. Each parser used to check only its own entries, and the apiserver does not catch the overlap: StatefulSet validation skips the pod template's volumes. The controller keys claim templates by name, so of two sharing one only one claim was created, and it replaced a pod volume named like a template with that template's claim, so the authored volume was never mounted. A repeated `mountPath` built and then failed pod creation. Such documents now fail at build time. The `configmap` and `external-secret` traits refuse a volume named like a claim template for the same reason. | behavior-changing |
| `name`, `mountPath`, `size` (claim) — wrong type | string | **Behavior-changing.** All three previously read through a bare type assertion, so a present-but-non-string value (YAML parses `size: 10e9` as a float and `mountPath: 7` as an int) collapsed to the empty string and was reported as the *requiredness* error — "missing required field 'size'" for a field the author had written. Each now rejects with an explicit type error naming the field and the type received. Acceptance does not widen: every one of these documents failed before and fails now, but with a message that points at the real defect. | behavior-changing |

Deliberately **not** accepted — each is rejected with an error naming the
reason rather than silently ignored:

- `spec.selector` (StatefulSet-level) — the builder derives it from the
  component name, and a StatefulSet's selector is immutable after creation.
- `spec.template` (StatefulSet-level, go-kure/launcher#790) — the pod template
  is projected from the component's own container and pod-level properties, as
  on `deployment`. The parser dropped an authored one before.
- `volumeName` (claim) — pre-binding a claim *template* to one named
  PersistentVolume would point every replica at the same volume.
- `volumeMount` (claim) — not a claim-spec field at all; the container mount
  is authored as `mountPath` (or, for a `volumeMode: Block` claim,
  `devicePath`) on the same entry.
- `dataSource` (claim) — when `dataSourceRef` carries no `namespace` the
  apiserver mirrors it into the superseded `dataSource` field, so authoring
  both is redundant; when it does carry a `namespace` the apiserver does not
  mirror, and `dataSource` must stay empty. Either way the field is authored
  through `dataSourceRef` alone.

The three claim-level refusals sit inside a `volumeClaimTemplates` entry, so
their reason reaches a caller of the handler; in a document the
authored-property check refuses the key first, with its own text and no reason
(see the section below).

## Upstream fields a hand-parsed kind does not read

Ten kinds read their properties key by key instead of decoding them into the
Kubernetes type: `deployment`, `statefulset`, `daemonset`, `job`, `cronjob`,
`service`, `persistentvolumeclaim`, `configmap`, `secret` and `serviceaccount`. The first
five build pods and are "the five pod-building kinds" below. For such
a kind an upstream field its parser does not know is no decode error; it is a
key the parser never looks at. The rule that closes that gap
(go-kure/launcher#790):

> Every field of the upstream type that such a kind does not read, under its
> name or in another shape, is an entry of one of the kind's refusal maps with
> its reason. No upstream field is dropped in silence.

`webservice` and `worker` lower to a `deployment` and refuse what it refuses;
the `pvc` trait reads a claim through the `persistentvolumeclaim` kind's
parser and refuses what that kind refuses, and the `secret` trait reads its
Secret through the `secret` kind's parser (`ParseSecretProperties`).

### The two paths

An authored key reaches a kind on one of two paths, and both give the reason:

- **A caller of the handler** (`ToApplicationConfig`, or `Transform` without
  the check below) gets the reason alone:
  `scheduling: not read by this component — alpha upstream, behind the WorkloadWithJob feature gate`.
- **A document** goes through the authored-property check first
  (`Transformer.ValidateAuthoredProperties`, which `kurel build` calls). The
  check refuses a key the kind does not declare before the parser runs, and
  appends the kind's reason to its own text:
  `component "batch" (type "job"): properties: unsupported field "scheduling" (allowed: …); scheduling: not read by this component — …`.
  The kind gives the reason through `UnsupportedFieldHint`
  (`pkg/oam`'s README, "A reason on a refused key").

### Below the top level

`UnsupportedFieldHint` answers for a kind's **top-level** keys. A refusal that
sits inside a property the kind declares reaches a caller of the handler with
its reason. In a document, the check refuses the key at that position with its
own text and appends the same reason, which the kind gives through
`NestedUnsupportedFieldHint` (go-kure/launcher#790):
`properties.affinity: unsupported field "nodeAffinity" (allowed: …); affinity.nodeAffinity: not read — …`.
The positions are:

| Position | On | Keys |
|----------|----|------|
| a container's `resources`: the main container's, and an `initContainers` or `sidecars` entry's | every workload kind | `claims` |
| the pod's `podResources` | every workload kind | `claims` (upstream validation forbids claims at pod level: "claims may not be set for Resources at pod-level") |
| an `initContainers` entry | every workload kind | `probes`, `lifecycle` (see [Container fields](#container-fields)) |
| the `affinity` shorthand | `webservice`, `worker` | `nodeAffinity`, `podAffinity`, `podAntiAffinity` |
| a `volumeClaimTemplates` entry | `statefulset` | `volumeName`, `dataSource`, `volumeMount` |

A key that is **no field of the upstream type** is not in a refusal map. The
check refuses it as it refuses any undeclared key, with nothing appended; a
caller that skips the check has it dropped, as `pkg/oam`'s README states for
every handler. The one exception is the six `CronJobSpec` keys `job` refuses by
name, which a `cronjob` document retyped to `job` leaves behind.

### Refused, with the reason

| Key | On | Why |
|-----|----|-----|
| `selector` | `deployment`, `statefulset`, `daemonset` (`webservice`, `worker`) | Builder-managed (`app: <component>`), equal to the template labels, immutable once created. |
| `selector`, `manualSelector` | `job`, `cronjob` | The job controller generates the selector from a per-job label; a hand-written one adopts another job's pods. |
| `scheduling` | `job`, `cronjob` | Alpha upstream, behind the `WorkloadWithJob` feature gate. |
| `restartPolicy`, `activeDeadlineSeconds` (the pod's) | `deployment`, `statefulset`, `daemonset` (`webservice`, `worker`) | apps/v1 validation accepts only `Always`, and no deadline, on these pod templates. On `job` and `cronjob` both names are read: the pod's `restartPolicy`, and the JobSpec's `activeDeadlineSeconds`. |
| `ephemeralContainers`, `priority`, `overhead`, `serviceAccount` | every workload kind | See [Pod-level properties](#pod-level-properties). |
| `evictionResponders` | every workload kind | Alpha upstream, behind the `EvictionRequestAPI` feature gate. |
| `restartPolicyRules` (the main container's) | every workload kind | Upstream accepts a container's restart rules only with the container's own `restartPolicy`, which no kind reads on the main container. An `initContainers` entry reads both (see [Container fields](#container-fields)). |
| `externalIPs`, `clusterIPs` | `service` | See the `service` kind. |
| `dataSource` | `persistentvolumeclaim`, the `pvc` trait | Authored through `dataSourceRef`. |
| `secrets` | `serviceaccount` | The list limits mountable Secrets only under an annotation upstream deprecates since Kubernetes 1.32; it is no way to find or create a token. |
| `resources.claims` | a container's `resources`, on every kind that reads them | An entry names one of the pod's `resourceClaims`, and a container's resources are read without them; upstream puts the field behind the `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature gate. See [Below the top level](#below-the-top-level). |
| `podResources.claims` | every workload kind | Upstream validation forbids claims in a pod's own resources ("claims may not be set for Resources at pod-level"); the pod's claims are its `resourceClaims`. See [Below the top level](#below-the-top-level). |

### Read in another shape

These upstream names are free on the kind and are refused too, with a reason
that names the properties the field is authored as:

| Upstream field | On | Authored as |
|----------------|----|-------------|
| the pod `template` | the five pod-building kinds | The component's own container and pod-level properties. Its metadata is not authored either: the kind's builder writes the `app: <component>` label and nothing else, the transform then adds the component label (`<domain>/component`, see [The `app` label](#the-app-label)), and a trait may add more. |
| `jobTemplate` | `cronjob` | The component's own job-level, pod-level and container properties. |
| `containers` | the five pod-building kinds | The main container is the component's container properties; further ones are `sidecars` entries on the kinds that have them. |
| the main container's `name` | the five pod-building kinds | Not authored: the container is named after the component. |
| `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, `startupProbe` | the five pod-building kinds | `probes.liveness`, `probes.readiness`, `probes.startup`. |
| `volumeMounts`, `volumeDevices` | the five pod-building kinds | A `volumes` entry's `mountPath`, or its `devicePath` for a `volumeMode: Block` claim. |
| `resources` (the claim's) | `persistentvolumeclaim`, the `pvc` trait | `size`, the storage request. A claim's limits are not read. |

Three pod fields are read under another name, because their upstream name is a
property of the kind already: `securityContext` as `podSecurityContext` and
`resources` as `podResources` (both names are the main container's), and on
`job` and `cronjob` the pod's `activeDeadlineSeconds` as
`podActiveDeadlineSeconds` (the name is the JobSpec's).

### One level down

Inside a container, go-kure/launcher#790 reads `securityContext.windowsOptions`
on every container, and an init container's own `restartPolicy` and
`restartPolicyRules` (see [Container fields](#container-fields)). Three upstream
fields one level down stay unread, and are refused at their position as an
unknown key:

- **`lifecycle.stopSignal`**: upstream puts it behind the `ContainerStopSignals`
  feature gate, alpha and off by default through Kubernetes 1.37, and holds the
  signal to the pod's `os.name`. A container's `lifecycle` reads `postStart`
  and `preStop`.
- **`ports[].hostPort` and `ports[].hostIP`**: they bind a port on the node.
  No environment-policy switch covers that (`AllowHostNetwork()` gates the
  node's network namespace, not a port bound from the pod's own), and whether
  the port is free is the scheduler's question, on cluster state. A `ports`
  entry reads `containerPort`, `name` and `protocol`.

### Not authorable, and not refusable by name

One case has no key a refusal could sit on: a name taken on this kind by
another upstream field of the same name. On `job` and `cronjob`,
`restartPolicy` is the pod's, so the main container's own `restartPolicy`
cannot be authored and cannot be refused. On `cronjob`, `suspend` is the
CronJob's, so the job template's `suspend` cannot either (see "One JobSpec
field is deliberately not shared" above).

### Outside the properties

The object's envelope is not a property of the kind's own schema: its
`apiVersion` and `kind` are the component's type, its `metadata` is the
component's name and the `objectName`, `labels` and `annotations` properties
every kind takes, and `status` is the cluster's. `spec` is the level whose
fields the properties are, and has no key of its own.

### An explicit null on a refused key

A null carries no content, and the kinds differ on what the parser makes of it
on a key they refuse. This is each kind's behavior from before
go-kure/launcher#790, left as it was:

- **Read as unauthored:** `service` and `persistentvolumeclaim` on every key
  they refuse, and `deployment` on the pod-level and container-level keys (not
  on `selector` and `template`).
- **Refused, as any value is:** `statefulset`, `daemonset`, `job`, `cronjob`,
  `serviceaccount`, and `webservice` and `worker`; and every kind on
  `resources.claims`, on `podResources.claims` and on the keys refused under
  the `affinity` shorthand.

In a document the difference does not show: the authored-property check
refuses an undeclared key whatever its value, null included.

### What holds this

- `TestHandParsedKinds_CoverEveryUpstreamField` walks the upstream type of
  each of the ten kinds, from the object down every level whose fields are
  the component's properties, and fails on a field that is neither read, nor
  refused, nor placed in one of the classes above — so a field a later
  `k8s.io/api` adds cannot be dropped in silence. It stops at the properties:
  what a property holds inside is held to the upstream type only for a
  container's `resources` and the pod's `podResources`.
- `TestRefusedKeys_BothPathsGiveTheReason` holds every entry of every refusal
  map to the two texts above; `TestRefusedKeys_OneLevelDown` holds the two
  refusals inside a declared property.
- `TestHandParsedKinds_MatchExpressionsAtEverySelector` runs a match
  expression through each of the 47 label selectors these kinds read, to the
  generated object, and five defective ones to their refusal.
- `TestHandParsedKinds_TemplateMetadataAndContainerName` and
  `TestHandParsedKinds_ServicePortFieldsReachTheObject` pin the template's
  metadata, the main container's name and the six fields of a Service port.

## Extending

Custom component types implement `oam.ComponentHandler` (`CanHandle` +
`ToApplicationConfig`) and are registered alongside the built-ins. Exported helpers:
`ValidateImageRef` (image policy), `BuildPVC` (PVC from a `PVCConfig`), and the
`persistentvolumeclaim` kind's claim path, `ParseClaimProperties`,
`ApplyClaimPolicy` and `GenerateClaim`, which the `pvc` trait builds through. A custom
`Generate()` that builds standalone PVCs from a `PVCConfig` list should qualify their
names with the component name the way the role kinds do — see `roleClaims`
(unexported, `role_members.go`) — to avoid two components colliding on the same
pod-local volume name.

See [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam/builtin/components)
for the full type/field reference, the [OAM model](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam)
for the handler interfaces, and `examples/` for runnable applications.

## The null contract

Every table above answers "what does an explicit `null` mean here?" one field at a
time. This is the rule they are all instances of:

> A value that serializes to JSON null is absent, at every depth, on every path; a
> null is never a member of any `Items` type, so a null array element is a type
> error; reservation is about the KEY being written.

It is written down because "null" has several readers — the emission validator's
requiredness check and its optional-key strip, its array-element guard,
`enforcePlatformReserved`, this package's parsers, and the Kubernetes API itself —
and each was aligned separately, so each round of review found the reader the last
round had not touched.

What it means for a handler parser in this package: read a null under an optional
property as omission, never as a present value of the wrong type. `authoredValue` —
the presence primitive `parseStringField`, `parseObjectField`, `parseInt32Field`,
`parseInt64Field`, `parseObjectList` and `parseStringList` all go through — does
exactly that, so calling any of them directly already complies. They classify a
**typed** nil as null too — `map[string]any(nil)` or `[]any(nil)` inside an `any`,
which is what a lowering rule assembled in Go produces for an unset optional and is
not `== nil`.

This used to require a separate `optional*` wrapper family (`optionalString`,
`optionalObject`, `optionalInt32`, `optionalInt64`, `optionalObjectList`,
`optionalStringList`) layered in front of the plain parsers. `go-kure/launcher#394`
moved the handling into the shared helpers themselves, which made every wrapper an
exact no-op forward; they were removed and every caller now uses the `parse*` helper
directly.

`TestNoOptionalFieldWrappers` (`no_optional_wrappers_internal_test.go`) keeps them
removed: it fails on any function or method whose name starts with `optional`. It
parses every production `.go` file directly in this package's directory — every
file, not only `common.go`, and never a `_test.go` file or a subdirectory — and
fails if it parsed none, so a wrong working directory cannot pass it vacuously. A
new optional field is read with the helper for its type instead: `parseStringField`
(or `requiredStringField` when the field is required), `parseBoolField`,
`parseInt32Field`, `parseInt64Field`, `parseObjectField`, `parseObjectList` or
`parseStringList`. Each already reads an explicit null as absence through
`authoredValue`, so a wrapper would only repeat that check.

Two limits worth knowing before relying on the rule:

- **A parser that answers presence with a bare `v, ok := props[key]` does not comply
  on its own.** It reads a present null as present. Emission validation deletes such
  keys before a rule-emitted component is converted, so on that path those parsers
  agree with the contract *because of the strip*, not independently of it. The
  authored path has no top-level strip: `ValidateAuthoredProperties` checks shape and
  leaves a top-level null in place, so there the null reaches the parser. What it
  does next depends on how the parser consumes the lookup: one that type-checks the
  value refuses it as a wrong type, while one that discards a failed assertion treats
  it as absent without saying so. `go-kure/launcher#423`, `go-kure/launcher#394` and `go-kure/launcher#570`
  converted the parsers they covered; the last of them are listed with the `null`
  row of the `deployment` table above.
- **An empty object is not a null and is not absent.** `{}` and an absent key mean
  different things to Kubernetes wherever a `LabelSelector` is involved, so the
  contract must never be read as licence to collapse them. What each one *means* is
  per field, not a property of selectors in general — the two selectors in a single
  `corev1.PodAffinityTerm` disagree, in upstream's own words:

  | field | null | `{}` |
  |---|---|---|
  | `labelSelector` | "matches with no Pods" | matches every pod in scope |
  | `namespaceSelector` | "this pod's namespace" | "matches all namespaces" |

  So "empty matches everything, nil matches nothing" holds for `labelSelector` and is
  wrong for `namespaceSelector`, where nil is the *narrowest* answer rather than the
  emptiest one.

Both limits met on one key, and it was the second row of that table.
`namespaceSelector` is parsed twice in this repository: here, for pod affinity,
through `parseSchedulingSelector` (`parseObjectField`), where any null is
omission — which upstream reads as "this pod's namespace"; and in the
networkpolicy trait, through `parseNPPeer`. A *typed* nil used to satisfy the
networkpolicy trait's own type assertion and yield an empty selector — all
namespaces, the widest possible answer — while an untyped nil already read as
omission there, so one input landed on opposite ends of the range depending on
which Go nil shape produced it. Both parsers now route their presence check
through `oam.IsNullValue`'s reflect-based classification, which treats a typed
nil the same as an untyped one, so the two halves converge: a null
`namespaceSelector`, however it was constructed, is omission on both paths.
Fixed as `go-kure/launcher#430`; `networkpolicy_internal_test.go`'s
`TestParseNPPeer_NamespaceSelectorPresenceCases` pins the typed-nil case
directly.

The same typed-nil shape reached **list elements**. `parseObjectList` read a
null key as absence, but a typed-nil *element* (`[]any{map[string]any(nil)}`)
passed its per-element assertion as an empty object, where an untyped null
element is refused (`tolerations[0]: must be an object, got <nil>`). Most
callers then failed on a missing required field anyway. `tolerations` did not:
an empty entry became an `Exists` toleration with no key, which tolerates
**every** taint. The element is now normalised to a null first, so every caller
refuses both shapes identically (go-kure/launcher#465). The list readers that
do not go through `parseObjectList` (`envFrom`, `httpHeaders`, `volumes`,
`volumeMounts`, sidecar `ports`, the Job `successPolicy`/`podFailurePolicy` rules and
`onPodConditions`, `volumeClaimTemplates`, `valuesFrom`, `scopeOverrides`) pass each
element through `nullElem` first, for the same untyped refusal and message.

## Conventions

Handlers use `k8s.io/api` constants for well-known Kubernetes enum values (access
modes, restart policies, etc.) rather than string literals — never re-define values
that already exist upstream.

Every generated object owns its label maps. `Generate` hands back objects the caller
owns and routinely edits — stamping ownership, environment or version labels onto the
workloads it emits — so no two fields and no two objects ever share one
`map[string]string`. Concretely: the object's `metadata.labels`, the pod template's
`metadata.labels`, the Service selector and the `labelSelector` of every topology
spread constraint and pod anti-affinity term are separate maps with equal contents.
Inside this package `appLabels` and `selectorFrom` (both unexported, `common.go`) are
what enforce that: call `appLabels` once per assignment rather than hoisting its result
into a variable used twice, and let `selectorFrom` copy what it is handed rather than
store it. A custom handler outside this package cannot call either and does not need to
— the rule is to build a fresh `map[string]string` at each assignment site, and to
`maps.Clone` any map before storing it in a selector.

This is a correctness rule, not tidiness. A selector that aliases the pod template's
labels follows the caller's edits, and a topology spread constraint's `labelSelector`
defines the pod set over which skew is computed — so a version label leaking into it
makes a rollout spread each version separately instead of spreading the workload.

The same rule runs in the other direction: **a generated object never shares a pointer
or a map with the config that produced it.** A handler config is reusable — the same one
can be rendered more than once — so every value a `*SpecConfig.apply` projects onto a
generated object is deep-copied on the way out: the claim template's `selector`,
`resources.limits`, `dataSourceRef`, `volumeMode` and `volumeAttributesClassName`, and at
the workload level `updateStrategy` (whose struct holds a pointer, so `*c.UpdateStrategy`
alone would not be enough), `revisionHistoryLimit`, `persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy`
and `ordinals`. The deployment kind projects the same two shapes and follows the same rule:
`strategy` (holding a `*RollingUpdateDeployment`), `revisionHistoryLimit` and
`progressDeadlineSeconds`. `applyJobSpec` follows the same rule for the `job` and `cronjob`
kinds: its ten scalar pointers go through the generic `copyPtr`, and `successPolicy` and
`podFailurePolicy` — whose structs each own a slice of rules — through `DeepCopy`.
The pod template every workload kind shares follows it too: `buildPodSpec` starts from a
`DeepCopy` of the authored pod-level fields (`nodeSelector`, `podSecurityContext`,
`terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, `imagePullSecrets`, …) and deep-copies each volume,
toleration, topology spread constraint, the affinity, and the main, init and sidecar
containers as it adds them — an `append` alone copies the element structs but shares the
pointers, maps and slices they carry. The `postgresql` Cluster follows it for
`spec.inheritedMetadata`: its `labels` and `annotations` are clones of the config's
`InheritedLabels`/`InheritedAnnotations`, not the maps themselves
(go-kure/launcher#396). Without that, editing the first rendered object — the same in-place
customization the label rule above assumes — writes back into the config and reappears in
every later render, with the symptom surfacing on a different object than the one that was
edited.

### The `app` label

Every `app` label and `app` selector this package generates to identify a component is
valued at `oam.ComponentLabelValue(<component>)`, never the raw component name —
`appLabels` and `deploymentComponentLabels` call it, and nothing else writes the value.
Authored values are emitted as written: an authored `selector` on a `service` component
replaces the generated one and is not projected, and a type that emits authored objects
(`passthrough`, for one) adds no `app` label. The one authored value that is checked is
an `app` label on the pod template of a `replicaset` or `replicationcontroller` component, which gets the generated
label beside its authored ones: the component's own label value is kept, another is
refused. A component name
is a DNS-1123 subdomain (up to 253 characters), a label value at most 63: the function
returns a name of 63 characters or fewer unchanged, so output for those names is
byte-identical, and projects a longer one onto a readable prefix of at most 52 characters
(its first 52, with trailing `-` and `.` trimmed) plus `-` and
a 10-hex-character sha256 digest (go-kure/launcher#572). The workload kinds and `service` never reach
the projection, since their container name or Service name already refuses a name over 63
characters; the `helm` values ConfigMap and values Secret do (a values
ConfigMap that previously omitted `app` past 63 characters now carries the projected value). Object names are not projected. A custom handler
that labels its objects by component uses the same function, so its selectors and the
built-in traits' selectors (a PodDisruptionBudget, a NetworkPolicy `podSelector`) agree.

The component label (`<domain>/component`) is not this package's to write: the transform
adds it to every object a component's config generates, and to its pod templates, with the
authored component's value, where the key is absent (go-kure/launcher#788). Where the key is
there with another value, the transform's output is refused when it is generated
(go-kure/launcher#790): that holds for what a component type of this package emits from
authored objects or a rendered chart (`passthrough`, `manifests`, `helmtemplate`, `helm`
under template delivery) as for any other, so the key is one nothing else writes. A lowered part
named differently from its component (the `postgresql` pooler, a database, an object store)
carries the component's value, not its own name. A source a lowering rule generates and the
application bundle holds (the repository a `helm` component generates) carries none. A
`HelmRelease` also gets a post-renderer that sets the label on the chart's pod templates.
See "Component label and ownership" in the
[OAM model](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam).

### The object name (`objectName`)

Every kind component takes `objectName`, which names its one object in place of the component
name (go-kure/launcher#787): every component type with a handler
(`builtinComponentHandlers`) but four, as `TestObjectName_EveryComponentTypeChooses`
(`pkg/cmd/kurel`) holds; a type that is lowered to others has none. `helmtemplate`,
`manifests`, `crd` and `passthrough` generate no
single object named after the component and refuse it. The rules for the name, the `Naming`
hook's role `object` and the references that follow it are under "`objectName`: the object of
a kind component" in the
[OAM model](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/launcher/pkg/oam).

The property is not in any handler's `PropertySchema`: the engine adds it to the schema of
every type whose handler declares its object (`ComponentObject`, in `object_name.go` or, for
a kind added since, in the kind's own file),
reads it, and hands `ToApplicationConfig` the resolved name as `Component.ObjectName()`. A
handler's config carries it as `ObjectName`, empty when it is the component's name, and
`Generate` names the object with it. Everything else the handler writes keeps the component
name: the `app` label and selectors, the pod template's labels, the main container's name.
A handler's own check of the name (a Service's DNS-1035 label, a CloudNativePG Cluster's
length, a CronJob's 52 characters, a Job's 63 and the room an Indexed job's last index
needs) runs on the object name, since that is what the object carries.

What a config tells a trait or the transform about its object follows the object name: a
`service` component's `BackendServiceName`, a `serviceaccount` component's
`ServiceAccountName`, and the pod selector of a `cnpg-cluster` or `cnpg-pooler` endpoint. Two
consequences are the kind's own: a `statefulset`'s pods and claims take the StatefulSet's
name, so they follow `objectName`; a `helmrelease`'s `spec.releaseName` default stays the
component name, so the release does not.

### The object's labels and annotations (`labels`, `annotations`)

Every kind component, the same types that take `objectName`, takes two optional properties,
`labels` and `annotations`, each a map of strings (go-kure/launcher#790). They go on the
metadata of the component's one object and nowhere else. On a workload kind the pod template
keeps the labels of the kind, its `app` label and what `template.metadata` authors, and no
selector reads an authored label. `helmtemplate`, `manifests`, `crd` and `passthrough`
generate no single object named after the component and refuse both.

```yaml
- name: web
  type: deployment
  properties:
    image: ghcr.io/example/web:1.0.0
    labels:
      team: payments
    annotations:
      example.com/owner: "payments@example.com"
```

Refused, naming the component, the property and the key:

- a value that is no map, and an entry that is no string (quote a number or a boolean); a
  null value or entry is an absent one;
- a key or value the API server refuses: a label key or value that is no valid label, an
  annotation key that is no valid annotation key, annotations whose keys and values hold more
  than 262144 bytes together;
- the `app` label with another value than the component's (its name, or the hashed form of a
  name over 63 characters), which is what the kinds that set `app` select by;
- the component label key with another value than the component's (see "Component label and
  ownership" above);
- a key the kind already sets on its object with another value;
- a key the consumer reserved for itself (`ReservedMetadataKeys`), as on every generated
  object.

A label that names another object is the author's literal: it does not follow that object's
`objectName` or the `Naming` hook's answer for it. An object that belongs to another through
a label (an EndpointSlice's `kubernetes.io/service-name`) is written with the name the other
object takes.

An annotation a delivery engine acts on (a Flux annotation such as
`kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force`, for one) is written as authored too: launcher does not
refuse it and does not carry out what the engine does with it. `Transformer.WarnForcedVolumes`
warns about a PersistentVolume or PersistentVolumeClaim that has the force key enabled, and
changes nothing. A consumer that keeps such keys to itself reserves them with
`TransformContext.ReservedMetadataKeys`.

As `objectName`, the two are in no handler's `PropertySchema`: the engine adds them to the
schema of every type whose handler declares its object, reads and checks them, removes them
from the properties and hands `ToApplicationConfig` the result as
`Component.ObjectMetadata()`. A handler's config carries it as `Metadata` and `Generate` puts
it on the object through `kindObject`, the one helper every kind returns its object through
(the Flux sources through `emitFluxSource`, which does the same before it writes a long
`spec.timeout`). `TestObjectMetadata_EveryKindComponentTakesIt` holds every registered kind
to the two properties, so a kind added later cannot ship without them.

### A label selector's match expressions

A kind component whose spec holds a Kubernetes label selector (`metav1.LabelSelector`) decodes
it strictly, and the strict decode refuses nothing of a match expression: the Go type writes
`key` and `operator` whether or not they were authored, and reads any string as an operator.
Three defects of an expression are therefore refused where the component is read, with or
without an environment policy, each named by its path (go-kure/launcher#790):

- **An expression without its `key` or its `operator`**
  (`selector.matchExpressions[0].operator: required (the operator of the expression: In, NotIn,
  Exists or DoesNotExist)`). The object would carry `key: ""` or `operator: ""` and not show
  the omission.
- **An `operator` that is none of the four**
  (`selector.matchExpressions[0].operator: "Equals" is not a label selector operator (In, NotIn,
  Exists or DoesNotExist)`).
- **An operator and `values` that do not go together**: `In` or `NotIn` without a value
  (`selector.matchExpressions[0].values: required with the operator In (at least one value)`),
  `Exists` or `DoesNotExist` with one (`…values: not allowed with the operator Exists (it takes
  no value)`).

The API server refuses each of the three on every selector listed below, through one function,
`ValidateLabelSelectorRequirement` of `k8s.io/apimachinery`, and under every option it passes
that function. `TestValidateLabelSelector_MatchesAPIMachinery` holds launcher's check to the
linked function on those three.

**That function judges more, and these kinds do not.** It also refuses an expression `key` that
is no label name, an expression value that is no label value (on the objects that still check
it), and a `matchLabels` key or value that is no label name or value. Those are value rules,
left to the API server as for every typed kind: a selector with `key: "not a label"` builds
here and is refused at apply. An authored empty `key` (`key: ""`) is one of them: it differs
from an unauthored key only in that the unauthored one is refused here, and the API server
refuses both.

**Where it holds:**

| Kind | Selectors |
|---|---|
| `networkpolicy` | `podSelector`; the `podSelector` and `namespaceSelector` of every `ingress[].from[]` and `egress[].to[]` peer |
| `poddisruptionbudget` | `selector` |
| `clusterrole` | every entry of `aggregationRule.clusterRoleSelectors` |
| `pod`, and under `template.spec` `podtemplate`, `replicaset` and `replicationcontroller` | the `labelSelector` and `namespaceSelector` of every `podAffinity` and `podAntiAffinity` term, required or preferred; a topology spread constraint's `labelSelector`; a projected `clusterTrustBundle` source's `labelSelector`; the `selector` of a generic ephemeral volume's claim template |

A `replicaset`'s own `selector` is refused for the same defects by the check that compares it
with the `app` label, with apimachinery's reason and not the texts above (see its entry);
`TestReplicaSetSelector_RefusedAsAPIMachineryReadsIt` holds that to each of them. The Cilium
kinds hold the `key` and `operator` of Cilium's own selector type through the same required
list, with the same wording; their entries say what else Cilium requires.

**Presence only, where a CRD defines the object.** On the kinds below an expression without its
`key` or its `operator` is refused, by the same required list and in the same words. The CRD
requires both fields, and the Go type writes each whether or not it was authored, so the object
would not show the omission: the document as authored is one the API server refuses, and the
kind refuses the omission by presence, as it does every required field its type writes
unauthored. An authored empty string is a value, left to the API server. Nothing else of the
expression is refused: an operator that is none of the four and a mismatched `values` are left
to the API server and to the operator's own admission, since a CRD's schema requires the two
fields and says nothing of the pair.

| Kind | Selectors | Ground |
|---|---|---|
| `servicemonitor`, `podmonitor` | `selector` | the linked type, by the generator's rule (below) |
| `prometheus-probe` | `targets.ingress.selector` | the same |
| `alertmanager` | the selectors a `pod` holds, at the top of the spec; the `selector` of the claim template of `storage.volumeClaimTemplate` and of `storage.ephemeral`; `alertmanagerConfigSelector`; `alertmanagerConfigNamespaceSelector` | the same |
| `cnpg-cluster` | the `labelSelector` and `namespaceSelector` of every `affinity.additionalPodAffinity` and `affinity.additionalPodAntiAffinity` term, required or preferred; `topologySpreadConstraints[].labelSelector`; a `projectedVolumeTemplate` `clusterTrustBundle` source's `labelSelector`; the `selector` of `ephemeralVolumeSource.volumeClaimTemplate.spec` and of the `pvcTemplate` of `storage`, `walStorage` and each tablespace; `podSelectorRefs[].selector` | the Cluster CRD of the linked module |
| `cnpg-pooler` | under `template.spec`, the selectors a `pod` holds | the Pooler CRD of the linked module |
| `issuer`, `clusterissuer` | the `labelSelector` and `namespaceSelector` of every pod affinity and anti-affinity term of an HTTP01 solver's `podTemplate.spec.affinity`, under `ingress` and under `gatewayHTTPRoute` | the Issuer and ClusterIssuer CRDs of the linked module |
| `gateway`, `listenerset` | a listener's `allowedRoutes.namespaces.selector`; a Gateway's `allowedListeners.namespaces.selector` | the CRDs of both Gateway API channels |
| `cilium-nodeconfig` | `nodeSelector` | the CiliumNodeConfig CRD of the linked module |
| `secretstore`, `clustersecretstore` | `conditions[].namespaceSelector` | the linked type, by the generator's rule (below) |
| `clusterexternalsecret` | `namespaceSelector`; every entry of `namespaceSelectors` | the same |
| `imageupdateautomation` | `policySelector` | the same |
| `resourcesetinputprovider` | every entry of `selectors` | the ResourceSetInputProvider CRD of the linked module, and the linked type, by the generator's rule |
| `replicationsource`, `replicationdestination` | the `labelSelector` and `namespaceSelector` of every pod affinity and anti-affinity term of a mover's `moverAffinity`, required or preferred: `rclone`, `restic`, `rsyncTLS`, and on a source `syncthing` | the ReplicationSource and ReplicationDestination CRDs of the linked module |

The Prometheus operator's module, the External Secrets Operator's and Flux's image automation
module ship no CRD to read, so the ground of their kinds is the source of the linked
`metav1.LabelSelectorRequirement`; the Flux Operator's module ships its CRDs, and its kind is
held to both, to its CRD and, as the other Flux kinds are, to that source: the schema generators
require a field that carries no optional marker and whose json tag keeps it when empty, and
`key` and `operator` are such fields
where `values` is not. `TestMonitoringKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers`,
`TestExternalSecretsKinds_RequiredMatchSource` and `TestFluxKinds_RequiredMatchMarkers` derive
the two from that source by that rule, beside the fields the operator's own types mark
required, and hold each kind's list to them; on the monitoring kinds another field of an
embedded Kubernetes type that the rule requires fails there unless it is named with the reason
it is not refused, except on `alertmanager`, which embeds the pod spec's types and is held to
their match expressions only, as the `pod` kind is. CloudNativePG's admission webhook runs
apimachinery's whole selector validation on `podSelectorRefs[].selector`; that fuller check is
the operator's, not launcher's.

**Not held: the metric selectors of a `horizontalpodautoscaler`**
(`metrics[].object.metric.selector`, `metrics[].pods.metric.selector`,
`metrics[].external.metric.selector`). The API server's validation of an autoscaler does not
read them, and a kind does not refuse what the API admits.

A config that is exported (`NetworkPolicyConfig`, `PodConfig`, `PodTemplateConfig`,
`ReplicaSetConfig`, `ReplicationControllerConfig`) repeats at `Generate` the two checks its
typed value can show: the operator, an empty one included, and the pair. A missing `key` shows
only in what was authored, so it is refused where the component is read.
`TestLabelSelectorKinds_CoverEverySelector` walks the type of every strictly decoded kind and
fails on a selector path that is neither held nor listed as left out with its reason, so a
selector added by a dependency bump or a new kind cannot go unread. For a presence-only kind it
also reads the CRDs named above, fails where one does not require `key` and `operator` at a
held path, and asks the API server's own validation of a custom resource at each: the object
the kind emits for a whole expression is accepted, and the same object with the `key` or the
`operator` taken out is refused for that field alone. With the field as the empty string the
type writes, the object is accepted again, which is why the omission is refused where the
component is read.

The walk covers the kinds that decode a type. The hand-parsed kinds (`deployment`, `daemonset`,
`job`, `cronjob`, `statefulset`, `persistentvolumeclaim`) hold their selectors through their own
parser (`parseLabelSelectorOpts`), which refuses the same and more, so their absence from the
test's list is not a gap.

### Required fields a kind writes unauthored and does not refuse

A field the API requires can still reach the object unauthored. Where the Go type writes the
field whatever was authored (`""`, `0`, `{}`, `null`), the object carries a value the author
did not write and does not show the omission. A kind refuses the omission of such a field only
where its required list or its own validation names it (`helmrelease` checks a `valuesFrom`
entry's `kind` and `name` by hand); every other one is written and left to the API server and to
the operator. The section above and each kind's entry list the ones that are refused. This
section states the ones that are not, as they are at this pin.

**Families.** The test names each field by the type that holds it:

| Family | Owner type | Typical fields |
|---|---|---|
| `AFF` | the `core/v1` affinity terms: `NodeSelectorRequirement`, `PodAffinityTerm`, `PreferredSchedulingTerm`, `WeightedPodAffinityTerm` | a node selector requirement's `key` and `operator`; a pod affinity term's `topologyKey`; a weighted or preferred term's `weight`, `podAffinityTerm` and `preference` |
| `SEC` | `SeccompProfile`, `AppArmorProfile`, `Sysctl` | a profile's `type`; a sysctl's `name` and `value` |
| `POD` | any other `core/v1` type | the `key` of a secret or config map key reference; a container's `name`; an `imageCatalogRef`'s `kind` and `name` |
| `KIND` | a type of the kind's own API, or of `metav1` other than a label selector's match expression | an alertmanager's ephemeral claim template's `ownerReferences[]` fields; an HTTPRoute's `parentRefs[].name` and header match `name`/`value`; a CloudNativePG secret reference's `name` and `key`; a Database's `schemas[].name` |

A fifth family of the test, `SEL` (the `key` and `operator` of a `metav1` label selector's
match expression), has no member: those are refused on every kind
([A label selector's match expressions](#a-label-selectors-match-expressions)).

**Per kind.**

| Kind | Not refused | AFF | SEC | POD | KIND |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `issuer`, `clusterissuer` | 42 each | 36 | 6 | | |
| `replicationsource` | 113 | 72 | 16 | 25 | |
| `replicationdestination` | 85 | 54 | 12 | 19 | |
| `cnpg-cluster` | 157 | 18 | 7 | 52 | 80 |
| `cnpg-pooler` | 178 | 18 | 8 | 147 | 5 |
| `cnpg-database` | 11 | | | | 11 |
| `cnpg-objectstore` | 29 | | | 9 | 20 |
| `httproute` | 44 | | | | 44 |
| `grpcroute` | 34 | | | | 34 |
| `servicemonitor`, `podmonitor`, `prometheus-probe` | 19 each | | | 19 | |
| `alertmanager` | 241 | 18 | 8 | 207 | 8 |
| `helmrelease` | 17 | | | | 17 |
| `fluxcd-kustomization` | 14 | | | | 14 |
| `bucket`, `ocirepository` | 7 each | | | | 7 |
| `gitrepository` | 6 | | | | 6 |
| `helmchart`, `helmrepository` | 3 each | | | | 3 |

None is left on `certificate`, the eleven Cilium kinds, `gatewayclass`, `gateway`,
`listenerset`, `referencegrant`, `backendtlspolicy`, `tcproute`, `udproute`, `tlsroute`,
`metallb-ipaddresspool`,
`metallb-l2advertisement`, `metallb-bgpadvertisement`, `metallb-bgppeer`, `cnpg-imagecatalog`,
`cnpg-clusterimagecatalog`, `cnpg-backup`, `cnpg-scheduledbackup`, `cnpg-databaserole`,
`cnpg-publication`, `cnpg-subscription`, `prometheusrule`,
`artifactgenerator`, `fluxcd-alert`, `fluxcd-provider`, `fluxcd-receiver`, `imagepolicy`,
`imagerepository`, `imageupdateautomation`, `resourcesetinputprovider`, `secretstore`,
`clustersecretstore`, `externalsecret` and `clusterexternalsecret`. `metallb-bfdprofile` and
`metallb-community` are not measured: their CRDs require no field.
`TestRequiredWrittenKinds_CoverEveryCRDKind` holds the measured kinds to the kind inventory:
every `kind` row whose API group client-go's scheme does not register, so a CRD serves it, is
measured or named as not measured with its reason, so a new kind component of such an API
fails there until it is one or the other. Most members are written
`""`; the rest are `0` (mostly a preferred term's `weight` or a `port`), `{}`, `[]`, `null` or
an object of such values.

**What the API server makes of them** is a value rule of each field, not read here. One case is
shown: `imageCatalogRef` of `cnpg-cluster` and `pgbouncer.imageCatalogRef` of `cnpg-pooler`.
Its `kind` written `""` is refused by the CRD's own rule on the reference. Its `name` written
`""`, and on `cnpg-cluster` its `major` written `0`, are accepted by the API server and reach
the operator.

**Excluded as valid values.** A member whose written value the API takes as authored is not
listed: `cnpg-cluster`'s `instances` (`1`, the CRD's default) and
`postgresql.syncReplicaElectionConstraint.enabled` (`false`, which the CRD requires and gives
no default; the Go type's zero value is a valid one); of the Flux kinds, `interval` of
`bucket`, `fluxcd-kustomization`, `gitrepository`, `helmchart`, `helmrelease` and
`ocirepository` (`"1h0m0s"`, the kind's own default), a verification's `provider` on
`helmchart`, `helmrelease` (`chart.spec.verify.provider`) and `ocirepository` (`"cosign"`, the
API's default, which the kind writes), and `fluxcd-kustomization`'s `prune` (`false`, a valid
zero value). The test names the twelve and checks that their omission builds and writes
exactly that value.

**Method.** For each field the kind's API requires and its Go type writes unauthored,
`TestKindComponents_RequiredWrittenNotRefused` builds the kind with the field authored, with
the required fields around it filled, then builds it again with the field taken out. The field
is a member when the second build succeeds and the object still holds the field. A field under
a path the kind refuses whatever is authored there is skipped, and the test names those paths
with their reason: a `cilium-networkpolicy`'s `nodeSelector`, a `cnpg-pooler`'s
`template.spec.ephemeralContainers`, and the `generatorRef` of an `externalsecret`'s or a
`clusterexternalsecret`'s `data[].sourceRef`. A refused omission counts only where the error
names the field or one under it, by its full path; the two Cilium policy kinds refuse a label's
`key` and an ICMP field's `type` in their decode instead, with an error naming no field, and the
test names those with their reason. Any other field that cannot be measured fails the test. The
required lists are those of the CRDs of the linked modules. The Prometheus operator, Flux and
External Secrets kinds are read through the schema markers of their linked sources, by the same
reader as their own required-list tests; `resourcesetinputprovider` is read from the CRD the
flux-operator module ships. The members are pinned in
`testdata/required-written-not-refused.txt`, one line per field (kind, path, family, written
value). The test fails on any difference, a new member or one that is gone, so a dependency
bump or a kind change that moves the set fails CI; `UPDATE_REQUIRED_WRITTEN_PIN=1` rewrites
the file, and is refused where `CI` is set.

go-kure/launcher#883 (deferred) tracks a mechanism for this class.

### Every spec field is this package's to write

Since go-kure/launcher#361 this package builds against kure's release-1 builder
contract (`go-kure/kure` ≥ `v0.2.0-beta.11`). Under it a `Create<Kind>`
constructor returns an object carrying TypeMeta plus `metadata.name` and
`metadata.namespace` and **nothing else** — no labels, no annotations, no
selector, no injected defaults. Everything else is the handler's own literal or
an explicit field assignment. Two consequences a reader needs:

**`spec.selector` is written explicitly, and must agree with the pod template.**
Deployment, StatefulSet and DaemonSet all require `spec.selector` and get no
server-side default for it, so each handler assigns
`&metav1.LabelSelector{MatchLabels: …}` from the same helper that produced
`spec.template.metadata.labels` — `deploymentComponentLabels` for `deployment`
and for `worker`, which lowers to a `deployment` component (its affinity selector
uses `appLabels`), and `appLabels` for `webservice`, `statefulset` and `daemonset` (both
return a fresh `{"app": <label value>}` map, per the ownership rule above, valued
as [The `app` label](#the-app-label) describes). This is
the one field the compiler cannot check: a selector that disagrees with the
template labels compiles and is refused by the apiserver at apply time. `job` and
`cronjob` are the deliberate exception — the Job controller fills `spec.selector`
and its matching pod labels itself.

**Two injected defaults are gone from the emitted manifests.** The constructors
used to write `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent` onto every container and
`podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady` onto every StatefulSet; neither is emitted
now. `OrderedReady` is the apiserver's own default for that field, so that one
is unchanged in effect. `imagePullPolicy` is written only when a component
authors it (see [Container fields](#container-fields)); what follows is about
the omitted case. Kubernetes defaults an omitted
value from the image reference and keys that decision on the `latest` tag, so
what matters here is that no accepted image can carry one: `ValidateImageRef`
(`common.go`) refuses an untagged reference and an explicit `:latest` tag on
every main, init and sidecar image — including a digest reference that still
carries the tag (`repo:latest@sha256:...`), which it rejects for exactly this
reason. A digest reference with *no* tag is the case this argument does not
reach, and no golden covers that form; it is pinned by digest either way, and
this package does not assert what a cluster defaults for it. The argument is
about the *parsed* path, which is where `ValidateImageRef` runs
(`ToApplicationConfig`): a handler config a library consumer builds directly
carries whatever image it was given, so `:latest` with no pull policy remains
reachable that way. That is also the only other path with a delta here — raw
manifests, `passthrough`, Helm-rendered objects and Flux patches never went
through the constructors, so nothing was ever injected into them to lose.

A third delta from the same contract change is metadata rather than a default, but
belongs in the same inventory: under `valuesMode:
configMap` the generated values ConfigMap used to take an `app` label *and* an
`app` annotation from the constructor, both valued at the ConfigMap's own name
(`<component>-values`). It now carries the label only, valued at the component's
label value (`<component>`, projected when the name exceeds 63 characters — see
[The `app` label](#the-app-label)), matching every other object this package emits. A consumer
selecting that ConfigMap by `app=<component>-values` must be repointed.

The `obj.Annotations = nil`
assignments scattered through the handlers, which existed to strip the `app:`
annotation the constructors used to stamp, are now no-ops — kept so the field
stays at a known value regardless of what a future constructor does.

**`postgresql` writes every CNPG value itself (kure `v0.2.0-beta.13`).** kure's
release-2 builder contract retired the CNPG config-struct layer
(`cnpg.Cluster`/`Pooler`/`ObjectStore`/`Database` and their `*Options` types) that
`postgresql` used to go through. The handler then called the generated
`CreateCluster`/`CreatePooler`/`CreateObjectStore`/`CreateDatabase` and assigned the
upstream `cnpgv1` / barman-cloud structs directly. Since go-kure/launcher#281 the
`postgresql` rule builds those structs as the properties of the `cnpg-*` kind
components it lowers onto, whose `Generate` calls the same constructors, and
`enablePDB` comes from the post-policy step the rule attaches to the Cluster.
The values that layer used to inject are written explicitly, so the emitted
manifests are unchanged byte for byte: `enablePDB` (true only for more than one
instance), `primaryUpdateStrategy: unsupervised`, the `ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
`SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` key names on backup and objectStore credentials, the
barman-cloud WAL-archiver plugin entry when an `objectStore` is declared (its
plugin name and parameters were corrected afterwards by go-kure/launcher#643),
the pooler `type` (`rw` unless `ro` was authored) and its always-present
`pgbouncer` block, and `ensure: present` on every extension not authored `absent`.
The layer's guards are kept too: `inheritedMetadata`, `managed`, `bootstrap`,
`postgresql.synchronous` and the credential references are omitted when their input
is empty, a pooler `instances` of zero or less is omitted when nobody authored
it (an authored count is written as authored since go-kure/launcher#790, see
the postgresql entry), and a role's or database's `ensure` /
`databaseReclaimPolicy` is written only for `absent` / `delete`.
