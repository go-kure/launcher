# Patch - Declarative Resource Patching

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/go-kure/kure/pkg/patch.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-kure/kure/pkg/patch)

The `patch` package provides a JSONPath-based system for declaratively modifying Kubernetes resources. It supports both TOML and YAML patch file formats with structure-preserving modifications and variable substitution.

## Overview

Patches allow you to modify Kubernetes manifests without rewriting them. The system uses JSONPath expressions to target specific fields and applies changes while preserving the original YAML structure (comments, ordering, formatting).

## Patch File Formats

### TOML Format (`.kpatch`)

```toml
# Target a specific resource by kind and name
[deployment.myapp.spec]
replicas = 3

[deployment.myapp.spec.template.spec.containers.0]
image = "${app.image}:${app.tag}"
resources.requests.cpu = "200m"
resources.requests.memory = "256Mi"

# Append to a list with .-
[deployment.myapp.spec.template.spec.containers.-]
name = "sidecar"
image = "envoy:latest"
```

### YAML Format

```yaml
target:
  kind: Deployment
  name: myapp
patches:
  - path: spec.replicas
    value: 3
  - path: spec.template.spec.containers[0].image
    value: "nginx:latest"
```

## CLI Usage

The `kure patch` command provides a CLI for applying patches:

```bash
# Apply patches and write output
kure patch base.yaml patches/customize.kpatch -o output.yaml

# Preview changes without writing (diff mode)
kure patch --diff base.yaml patches/customize.kpatch

# Combine all patched resources into a single output
kure patch --combined base.yaml patches/
```

## Quick Start

```go
import "github.com/go-kure/kure/pkg/patch"

// Load patches from file
file, _ := os.Open("patches/customize.kpatch")
specs, err := patch.LoadPatchFile(file)

// Create patchable set with resources and patches
patchSet, err := patch.NewPatchableAppSet(resources, specs)

// Resolve targets and apply
resolved, err := patchSet.Resolve()
for _, r := range resolved {
    err := r.Apply()
}

// Write patched output
err = patchSet.WriteToFile("output.yaml")
```

## Key Features

### Variable Substitution

Patches support variable references that resolve against a parameter context:

```toml
[deployment.myapp.spec.template.spec.containers.0]
image = "${registry}/${image}:${tag}"
replicas = "${replicas}"
```

```go
varCtx := &patch.VariableContext{
    Variables: map[string]interface{}{
        "registry": "docker.io",
        "image":    "myapp",
        "tag":      "v1.0.0",
        "replicas": 3,
    },
}
specs, err := patch.LoadPatchFileWithVariables(file, varCtx)
```

### List Selectors

Target specific items in lists using selectors:

```toml
# By index
[deployment.myapp.spec.template.spec.containers.0]
image = "updated:latest"

# Append to list
[deployment.myapp.spec.template.spec.containers.-]
name = "new-container"

# By field value (name selector)
[deployment.myapp.spec.template.spec.containers.{name=myapp}]
image = "updated:latest"
```

### Structure Preservation

When using `NewPatchableAppSetWithStructure`, the original YAML document structure is preserved through patching, maintaining comments, key ordering, and formatting.

### Strategic Merge Patch

For broad document-level changes, strategic merge patch (SMP) deep-merges a partial YAML document into the target resource. Known Kubernetes kinds merge lists by key (e.g. containers by `name`); unknown kinds fall back to JSON merge patch (RFC 7386).

```yaml
- target: deployment.my-app
  type: strategic
  patch:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: main
            resources:
              limits:
                cpu: "500m"
          - name: sidecar
            image: envoy:v1.28
```

```go
// Enable kind-aware merging
lookup, _ := patch.DefaultKindLookup()
patchSet.KindLookup = lookup

// Detect conflicts before applying
resolved, reports, err := patchSet.ResolveWithConflictCheck()
```

SMP patches are applied before field-level patches. See [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/go-kure/kure/blob/main/pkg/patch/DESIGN.md) for full specification.
