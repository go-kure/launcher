# check-pin-impact.sh — render, and gate on, the real impact of a go-kure/.github
# pin bump before it merges.
#
# .github/workflows/*.yml pin go-kure/.github by commit SHA in two shapes: the
# `uses: go-kure/.github/.github/actions/<name>@<sha>` form (one per composite
# action consumed) and a `repository: go-kure/.github` / `ref: <sha>` checkout
# (the docs-build job's "Verify vendored guard matches canonical" checkout,
# which byte-compares the vendored guard, derives its ref from the
# check-forbidden-terms `uses:` pin through a `${{ }}` expression instead —
# see the "Resolve pinned guard revision" step).
# Renovate bumps every occurrence to the same new SHA in one
# PR (renovate.json's github-actions group), and its PR body offers nothing
# more than a compare link across the WHOLE dot-github repo — most of which
# (pr-review tooling, label taxonomy, docs) this repo never executes. Deciding
# "does this bump actually change anything this repo runs" required, by hand:
# list the actions referenced -> resolve each action.yml to the scripts/*.sh
# it runs -> resolve one level of `source` -> intersect that set against the
# compare's changed files (first worked out on go-kure/kure#719, then found
# to apply identically here — go-kure/launcher#358 was open with the exact
# same shape at the same time, 2026-08-30). This script does that
# intersection and fails when it's non-empty, so a bump that touches a path
# this repo actually executes cannot merge unreviewed. This is a vendored
# copy of go-kure/kure's script, adapted only in its repository-specific
# wording; scripts/test/cases/ carries that repository's cases for it under
# the same file names.
#
# Two modes:
#   --base-ref REF   CI mode. NEW pin state is read from the working tree's
#                    own .github/workflows/*.yml (must be internally
#                    consistent — every occurrence pinning the same SHA).
#                    OLD pin state is read the same way from `git show
#                    REF:<file>`. Fails if either side is inconsistent.
#   --old SHA --new SHA
#                    Manual/verification mode: skip reading pin state from
#                    any git ref: fetch action.yml/script content directly at
#                    the given SHAs. The set of ACTIONS to inspect still comes
#                    from the working tree (which actions are referenced
#                    doesn't depend on which commit go-kure/.github is at) —
#                    only which SHA their content is fetched at is overridden.
#                    Lets a bump be checked against arbitrary historical SHAs
#                    without checking out that exact repo state.
#
# CI images do not have mise installed and this job runs bare like
# action-pins — no yq, no python. Plain bash + curl + grep + sed + awk only.
#
# Followed:
#   - pins: `uses: go-kure/.github/.github/actions/<subpath>@<40-hex>`, the
#     subpath nested or dotted (`group/check`, `check.v2`), and the `ref:
#     <40-hex>` in the `with:` mapping of a block-style checkout step whose
#     same `with:` mapping holds `repository: go-kure/.github`, in any key
#     order; the repository name case-insensitively and with or without a
#     trailing `.git` (actions/checkout clones
#     https://github.com/<repository>), the hex in either case. A key is read as YAML reads it: `"uses":`, `'ref':` and
#     `repository :` are the plain keys, in a workflow and an action.yml.
#   - per action: each `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/<rel>.sh` (or
#     `${GITHUB_ACTION_PATH}/<rel>.sh`) in its one `run:` step, one whole
#     word and the command run (at a line start or after a separator,
#     optionally behind a shell keyword (`if`, `then`, `else`, `elif`, `do`,
#     `while`, `until`, `!`) and `exec`/`bash`/`sh`/`source`/`.` with
#     options), resolved against .github/actions/<subpath>/
#     with `..` hops counted.
#   - per script, transitively: a whole line `source|. "$SCRIPT_DIR/<name>.sh"`
#     or `[exec] [bash|sh] "$SCRIPT_DIR/<name>.sh" [args]` (args without
#     separators or substitutions; fd redirects, `&>file` and `&>>file`
#     allowed), resolved against the script's own directory, where SCRIPT_DIR
#     is defined as exactly `$(dirname "$0")`, `$(cd "$(dirname "$0")"
#     [&>/dev/null | >/dev/null [2>&1] | 2>/dev/null] && pwd [-P])` or either
#     with "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" for "$0", optionally behind `declare -r`,
#     `readonly` or `export`; `cd --`, `dirname --`, `1>` for `>` and a space
#     after `&>` or `>` are the same definition.
#   - the run-when-executed guard `if [[ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "$0" ]]`
#     (`!=`, `"${0}"`, `; then`), alone on its line, names no directory.
#
# Fails closed — aborts loudly rather than silently under-reporting the
# consumed set; a false "no impact" is the one failure mode this script
# exists to prevent — on:
#   - pins: inconsistent pins; a go-kure/.github reference in a `uses:` or
#     `repository:` context that yields no 40-hex pin (`@main`, a trailing
#     slash, `go-kure/.github@<sha>`, a subpath outside .github/actions, a
#     flow-mapping checkout, a checkout with a branch, another expression or
#     no `ref:`, a reusable-workflow call pinned to a SHA or inside a step) —
#     only a checkout whose `ref:` is exactly
#     `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<name> }}`, and a job-level reusable-workflow
#     call at a non-SHA ref (below), may carry none. A go-kure/.github
#     checkout step is also refused when it has a `ref:` other than a key
#     at the column of the `with:` mapping's first child (under `env:` or
#     another key, in a block scalar body, at the step's own level), a line
#     that is no key this scan parses (`a b:`, `a/b:`, the rest of a
#     multi-line value), a value that does not end on its line (an
#     unterminated or escaped quote), more than one `ref:` in any letter
#     case, or more than one `with:`. So is a `repository: go-kure/.github`
#     anywhere in a step but a key of its `with:` mapping (under `env:`,
#     deeper under `with:`, at the step's own level).
#   - workflow YAML the line scan cannot read, whatever it names: a
#     `uses:`/`repository:` value not whole on its own line (empty, continued
#     on the next line, a block scalar, an alias, anchor, tag or flow
#     collection, a quoted value with an escape — `\` in double quotes, `''`
#     in single quotes — or with no closing quote); a `repository:` given as
#     an expression; a `uses`/`repository` key that does not start its line
#     (a flow mapping, a tagged or anchored key) or is not in lower case; a
#     quoted key with an escape sequence; a `? ` complex key. A `uses:`
#     expression is refused only when it names go-kure/.github: GitHub does
#     not evaluate expressions in `uses:`.
#   - actions: `runs.using` other than composite (JavaScript and Docker
#     actions execute code no scan here can see), a `using` in a flow mapping
#     or not in lower case included; a nested `uses:`, flow-mapping, quoted
#     or in any letter case; more than one `run:` step, flow-mapping,
#     quoted and `RUN:` steps counted (the lines of a `run: |` body are
#     text, not keys); a `github.action_path` expression; $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH other
#     than as one whole `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/<path>` or
#     `${GITHUB_ACTION_PATH}/<path>` word — the path of `[A-Za-z0-9_./-]`,
#     then at most a closing quote, then whitespace, `;&|)<>` or the line end
#     (so not reassigned, `${GITHUB_ACTION_PATH%/*}`, a bare trailing `/`, a
#     path after a closing quote or a suffix after it); in an action that
#     mentions $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH, dirname, realpath, readlink, a parameter
#     trim (`${name%...}`, `${name#...}`, `${name/...}`, `${name:offset}`)
#     or a `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/<path>` word other than as the command run
#     (assigned, or passed as an argument); the runner's
#     `_actions` directory by path; a quoted key with an escape sequence or a
#     `? ` complex key; a `run:` step with no `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH` script; a
#     non-.sh `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH` target; a .sh path mentioned that no
#     `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH` reference accounts for; a '.'/'..' action subpath
#     segment; a path that climbs above the repository root or has an empty
#     (`//`) segment.
#   - scripts: any line using `$SCRIPT_DIR` that is not exactly one of the two
#     followed forms; any `SCRIPT_DIR=` assignment (with any prefix) that is
#     not exactly one of the definition shapes above; the word SCRIPT_DIR in
#     any other form (`SCRIPT_DIR+=`, `SCRIPT_DIR[0]=`, `read SCRIPT_DIR`, `for
#     SCRIPT_DIR in`, `n=SCRIPT_DIR`); name indirection — `${!name}` (not the
#     array-keys `${!name[@]}`), a `declare -n`/`local -n`/`typeset -n`
#     nameref, `eval`, a declare/typeset/local/export/readonly whose variable
#     name holds a `$` or a backtick (`declare -g "$n+=/lib"`); any other
#     line computing the script's own directory (dirname "$0", ${0%/*},
#     BASH_SOURCE, BASH_ARGV, a positional slice `${@:...}`/`${*:...}`, `$_`
#     or `${_}`, which follows an exempted `$0` message), or naming `$0` at all outside a message to
#     stderr (`echo "usage: $0 ..." >&2` or `1>&2`), a `sed -n '<lines>p'
#     "$0"` read of the script itself or an awk record (`f($0`, `, $0`, ` =
#     $0`, `$0 ~`, `$0 !~`) — `x=$0`, `a=($0)`, `printf -v`, `read <<<"$0"`,
#     a function argument or a message to another fd carry the directory
#     under another name; a line naming $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH or the runner's
#     `_actions` directory; any other `source`/`.`, or `bash`/`sh`/path
#     invocation of a .sh file, at a command position; a '.'/'..' or empty
#     segment in a sibling path; a sibling that cannot be fetched.
#   - where $SCRIPT_DIR is not the script's own directory: a file sourced
#     from a script in another directory that names SCRIPT_DIR at all (it
#     shares its caller's); a script run as its own process that uses
#     $SCRIPT_DIR before a trusted definition (it reads an inherited one); a
#     relative definition, `$(dirname "$0")`, in any walked script while any
#     walked script changes the working directory (`cd`, `pushd`, `popd`
#     outside a `$(cd` or `(cd` subshell).
#   - the compare: a status other than `ahead`; a file count near GitHub's
#     pagination cap.
#
# Not covered, knowingly. The threat model is a trusted organisation's own
# files: this gate catches shapes written by accident that would hide
# consumed code, not a determined adversary, and a shape built to evade a
# line scan can still pass.
#   - job-level reusable-workflow calls at a non-SHA ref, `uses:
#     go-kure/.github/.github/workflows/<file>.yml@<ref>`: they run at their
#     own ref (this repo's calls are @main), not at the action pin, so no
#     pin bump changes them and this gate neither pins nor audits them.
#   - a sibling reached without naming $SCRIPT_DIR, $0 or the checkout — a
#     hard-coded absolute path, a name found on PATH, or a path assembled at
#     run time (/proc/self, a variable filled from a file).
#   - definition order is line order: a trusted SCRIPT_DIR definition inside
#     a function or a branch that never runs still counts as defining it for
#     the lines below.
#   - a `,$0` outside awk is taken for an awk record (`for p in {x,$0}`).
#   - a `$0` message to stderr read back: the stderr exemption assumes
#     stderr is not redirected into a file or a capture (`exec 2>f`, `$(f
#     2>&1)`) that the script then reads.
#   - the script's path from the call stack, `caller`: it names no `$0`.
#   - an assignment through a name built at run time other than by a
#     declaration builtin: `printf -v "$n"`, `read "$n"`, `mapfile "$n"`
#     (a consumed script assigns through `printf -v "$destination"`).
#   - a declaration builtin not written as a plain word at a command
#     position: `\declare -g "$n+=/lib"`, `d=declare; $d -g ...`, or one
#     continued onto the next line with `\`.
#   - in an action's `run:` step, the action path carried past the command
#     and cut to its directory by a tool other than dirname, realpath,
#     readlink or a trim (sed, awk, cut, a Python one-liner): carried by `$_`
#     after the command, an array assignment `x=("$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/...")`
#     or an argument on a `\` continuation line.
#   - the action path read through a name built at run time
#     (`n=GITHUB_ACTION; n+=_PATH; "${!n}/..."`).
#   - false aborts, refused although harmless: a directory other than the
#     script's own derived from it, such as `ROOT=$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."
#     && pwd)` — following it would mean tracking an arbitrary variable
#     through every script that sources or inherits it, and real scripts
#     reuse such names for argument-derived paths; `uses:` or `repository:`
#     text anywhere in a single-line workflow value (`run: grep -n
#     "repository:" ci.yml`, `with: { repository: foo/bar }`), and `ref:`
#     text anywhere in a checkout step of go-kure/.github, and a ` #` inside
#     a quoted value there (read as a comment, leaving the quote open); a
#     second `repository: go-kure/.github` outside the `with:` mapping of a
#     checkout that already names it there (under `env:`);
#     `${!prefix@}`, `export SCRIPT_DIR` or `readonly SCRIPT_DIR` on a line
#     of its own; dirname, realpath, readlink or a parameter trim anywhere in
#     an action that mentions $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH, and a
#     `$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/<path>` command behind a wrapper (`env`,
#     `timeout`), an environment assignment (`VAR=1 "$GITHUB_ACTION_PATH/..."`),
#     a shell option (`bash --noprofile`), a `{ ...; }` group or a `case` arm.
#
# A genuine hit (a consumed path did change) is not necessarily wrong to
# merge — the pin bump may have been reviewed and found fine. There is no
# reviewer-facing way to express that short of a maintainer adding the
# `pin-impact-ack` label to the PR (same convention as check-doc-gate's
# `docs-skip`), which this script honours via PIN_IMPACT_ACK=true — a
# deliberate, audited override, never a silent pass.

# scan_workflow -- read one workflow file's content on stdin and account for
# every go-kure/.github reference in it. Prints one record per line:
#   pin <sha>      a 40-hex pin (uppercase hex is read, and printed lowercased)
#   action <sub>   the <subpath> of a pinned `uses:` action
#   bad <n>: <l>   line <n> references go-kure/.github in a `uses:` or
#                  `repository:` context but yields no pin
#
# `uses:` pins: the value must be exactly
# `go-kure/.github/.github/actions/<subpath>@<40-hex>`, the repository name
# matched case-insensitively (GitHub's are) and anchored at the value's start
# (so `xgo-kure/.github/...` is another repo, not this one). The subpath may be
# nested (`group/check`) or dotted (`check.v2`); a single-segment pattern used
# to skip both (go-kure/kure#731 round 9). A '.'/'..' segment is accepted here
# and refused where the action is resolved.
#
# `repository: go-kure/.github` checkouts: the `ref:` key of the step's own
# `with:` mapping is the pin, whatever the order of the step's keys (it used
# to be only a `ref:` on the very next line, round 9). The `repository:` is
# read at the same key position as that `ref:`; one anywhere else in the step
# is refused, since it used to mark the step as this checkout and make
# another repository's `ref:` a pin (go-kure/kure#901). The repository value
# is matched case-insensitively and with or without a trailing `.git`:
# actions/checkout clones https://github.com/<value>, which names the same
# repository either way. A step is a list item: it runs from its `-` line
# until the next line indented no deeper than that dash, so a nested list
# inside the step stays part of it and another step's `ref:` is never
# attributed to this checkout. Within the step, a key stack tracks the mapping
# each key sits in, and the pin is a `ref:` key at the column of the `with:`
# mapping's first child. A `ref:` anywhere else (under `env:` or another key,
# off that column, at the step's own level, in a block scalar body, in a flow
# mapping), a second `ref:` in any letter case (action inputs are
# case-insensitive) or a second `with:` makes the checkout refused — any of
# them used to be read as the pin, the last one winning, so a decoy at the new
# SHA hid the real checkout (go-kure/kure#888 review). The key stack sees only
# keys it parses, so a checkout step with any other line (a key such as `a
# b:` or `a/b:`, the rest of a multi-line value) or a value that does not end
# on its line is refused too: either could put a `ref:` that reads as
# `with.ref` somewhere else in YAML. A `ref:` that is exactly
# `${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<name> }}` (the forbidden-terms checkout derives its
# ref from a `uses:` pin that way) is no pin and no refusal; any other
# expression is refused, since it could name any commit.
#
# Completeness: anything else in a `uses:`/`repository:` context that names
# go-kure/.github — `@main`, a trailing slash, `go-kure/.github@<sha>`, a
# subpath outside .github/actions, a flow mapping `{ repository: ..., ref: ...
# }`, a checkout with a branch or no `ref:` — used to be skipped, silently
# dropping its SHA from the consistency check (go-kure/kure#731 review of
# go-kure/kure#886). It is reported as `bad` and the caller refuses the run.
# The one other exemption is a job-level (not in-step) reusable-workflow call,
# `uses: go-kure/.github/.github/workflows/<file>.yml@<ref>`, at a non-SHA ref.
# Comment lines and trailing ` #` comments are ignored; a mention of
# go-kure/.github in any other context (a `run:` string, a `name:`) is not a
# pin and not counted.
#
# Keys are read as YAML reads them (go-kure/kure#888): a quoted `"uses":` or
# `'repository':`, or one with a space before its colon, is the plain key. A
# quoted key with an escape sequence, which could spell any key, and a `? `
# complex key are refused. A `uses:`/`repository:` value must be readable
# whole from its own line — not continued on the next line, not a block
# scalar, alias, anchor, tag or flow collection, not a quoted value with an
# escape (`\` in double quotes, `''` in single quotes) or with no closing
# quote — and a `repository:` may not be an expression: any of them could
# name go-kure/.github without spelling it here, so each is refused whatever
# it names. So is a `uses`/`repository` key anywhere else on a line (a flow
# mapping, a tagged key) or in another letter case, mention or not; the
# `uses:`/`repository:` text inside a single-line value (`run: grep -n
# "repository:" ci.yml`) is refused the same way, a known false abort. A
# `uses:` expression is not refused as such (GitHub does not evaluate
# expressions in `uses:`); it is refused only when it names go-kure/.github
# and yields no pin. Lines inside a block scalar
# (a `run: |` body) are text, and are held only to the checks above this
# paragraph.
#
# Plain POSIX awk (no interval expressions, no gawk extensions): the pin-impact
# job runs bare.

  # abort below — a silent miss, not a fail-closed one (found by
  # chatgpt-codex-connector review on go-kure/kure#729, 2026-08-30).
  # Comment lines are excluded first: without that, the English word
  # "source" inside a comment or string (e.g. real content in
  # check-doc-sync.sh: `fail "extra_mounts source not found: $src"`) would
  # false-positive as a candidate and abort the run on nothing — confirmed
  # against that exact file. Restricting the "preceded by" side to a real
  # separator (line start, `;`/`&`/`|`, or `then`/`do`) rather than any
  # whitespace keeps that same false-positive class out of non-comment code
  # too, at the cost of not catching every conceivable compound shape — an
  # unrecognized one still aborts via the branch below, so under-reporting
  # isn't the failure mode this trades away.
  #
  # A sibling run as a subprocess rather than sourced (`bash
  # "$SCRIPT_DIR/helper.sh"`, `sh ...`, `exec ...`, or the path itself as the
  # command word) executes just the same, but the walk only followed
  # `source`/`.` — the helper never reached the consumed set, so a change to
  # it read as inert (go-kure/kure#731 round 8). And a scan keyed on the
  # command position still missed every call that does not sit right after a
  # separator: `if ! bash ...`, `command`/`env`/`nice`/`timeout` wrappers,
  # `FOO=1 bash ...`, `{ ...; }`, `( ... )`, `$( ... )`, `cat x | bash`, a
  # path stored in a variable first, `find -exec`, a non-.sh sibling
  # (go-kure/kure#731 review of go-kure/kure#886). So the rule is keyed on the
  # token instead: every line that uses $SCRIPT_DIR must be exactly the
  # whole-line source or subprocess form (SOURCE_RE / EXEC_RE, one $SCRIPT_DIR
  # on it), every `SCRIPT_DIR=` assignment must be exactly one of the trusted
  # definitions (SCRIPT_DIR_DEF_RE) — otherwise $SCRIPT_DIR could name any
  # directory — and every other line that computes the script's own directory
  # (dirname "$0", ${0%/*}, BASH_SOURCE) is refused — otherwise the directory
  # could be carried under another name.
  # The separator-anchored source and subprocess scans stay as a backstop for
  # `source "$OTHER/x.sh"`, `./x.sh`, `bash x.sh` and the like. Keying on a
  # bare `bash` word is deliberately avoided: real scripts run generated
  # content with `bash "$GEN"`.
