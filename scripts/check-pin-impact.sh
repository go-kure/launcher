# check-pin-impact.sh — render, and gate on, the real impact of a go-kure/.github
# pin bump before it merges.
#
# .github/workflows/*.yml pin go-kure/.github by commit SHA in two shapes: the
# `uses: go-kure/.github/.github/actions/<name>@<sha>` form (one per composite
# action consumed) and, in the job that verifies the vendored downstream-
# reference guard, a `repository: go-kure/.github` / `ref: <sha>` checkout
# (this repo derives that `ref:` from the `uses:@sha` pin at CI-run time
# rather than duplicating it — see the "Resolve pinned guard revision" step —
# but this script still recognizes a literal `ref:` SHA for repos, like
# go-kure/kure, that pin it by hand). Renovate bumps every `uses:@sha`
# occurrence to the same new SHA in one PR (renovate.json's github-actions
# group), and its PR body offers nothing more than a compare link across the
# WHOLE dot-github repo — most of which (pr-review tooling, label taxonomy,
# docs) this repo never executes. Deciding "does this bump actually change
# anything this repo runs" required, by hand: list the actions referenced ->
# resolve each action.yml to the scripts/*.sh it runs -> resolve one level of
# `source` -> intersect that set against the compare's changed files
# (first worked out on go-kure/kure#719, then found to apply identically
# here — go-kure/launcher#358 was open with the exact same shape at the
# same time, 2026-08-30). This script does that intersection and fails when
# it's non-empty, so a bump that touches a path this repo actually executes
# cannot merge unreviewed.
#
# Two modes:
#   --base-ref REF   CI mode. NEW pin state is read from the working tree's
#                    own .github/workflows/*.yml (must be internally
#                    consistent — every occurrence pinning the same SHA).
#                    OLD pin state is read the same way from `git show
#                    REF:<file>`. Fails if either side is inconsistent.
#   --old SHA --new SHA
#                    Manual/verification mode: skip reading pin state from
#                    any git ref: fetch action.yml/script content directly at
#                    the given SHAs. The set of ACTIONS to inspect still comes
#                    from the working tree (which actions are referenced
#                    doesn't depend on which commit go-kure/.github is at) —
#                    only which SHA their content is fetched at is overridden.
#                    Lets a bump be checked against arbitrary historical SHAs
#                    without checking out that exact repo state.
#
# CI images do not have mise installed and this job runs bare like
# action-pins — no yq, no python. Plain bash + curl + grep + sed + awk only.
#
# Fails closed: any construct this script cannot confidently resolve (an
# ambiguous/inconsistent pin, a `source` line it doesn't recognize the shape
# of, a compare response near GitHub's pagination cap) aborts loudly rather
# than silently under-reporting the consumed set. A false "no impact" is the
# one failure mode this script exists to prevent.
#
# A genuine hit (a consumed path did change) is not necessarily wrong to
# merge — the pin bump may have been reviewed and found fine. There is no
# reviewer-facing way to express that short of a maintainer adding the
# `pin-impact-ack` label to the PR (same convention as check-doc-gate's
# `docs-skip`), which this script honours via PIN_IMPACT_ACK=true — a
# deliberate, audited override, never a silent pass.
#
# Usage: check-pin-impact.sh --base-ref origin/main
