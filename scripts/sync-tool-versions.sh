# Both patterns below match anything scripts/check-tool-versions.sh's own count/extraction

# Temp-file + mv, not `sed -i -E` — this script declares itself #!/bin/sh (portable POSIX),

# `-E` as that suffix: the substitution then runs as a literal BRE (no groups), nothing
# matches, and a stray `Makefile-E`/`ci.yml-E` is left behind. The self-verify below would
# then fail with a misleading "a target file's format probably drifted" — sync-govulncheck-docs.sh
# already avoids this the same way.
