# Row 131 (go-kure/kure#901): a step is the go-kure/.github checkout when its
# `with:` mapping holds `repository: go-kure/.github`, at the column of that
# mapping's keys, as its `ref:` must be. A `repository:` line anywhere else in
# the step (under `env:`, deeper under `with:`, or a key of the step itself)
# used to mark the step as that checkout, so an unrelated checkout's `ref:` was
# read as a go-kure/.github pin and the check aborted on "inconsistent pins".
# Such a line is now a mention this scan cannot read, refused by its line.
