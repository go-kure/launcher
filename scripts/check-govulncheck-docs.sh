# check-govulncheck-docs.sh — enforce parity between the govulncheck version pinned in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml's env: block and every mention of it in docs/github-workflows.md.
#
# Unlike golangci-lint (source of truth: mise.toml, a file none of its own targets are),
# govulncheck's source of truth is ci.yml itself — the same file Renovate's customManagers
# regex entry in renovate.json bumps directly. Before that customManager existed, govulncheck
# was invisible to Renovate and any manual bump landed in the same PR as its doc updates; now
# that it can update automatically, an automated bump leaves the docs stale unless something
# enforces parity.
#
# CI images do not have mise installed, so this is a plain POSIX shell script CI can run
# directly — it must NOT depend on mise.
#
# Exit non-zero on any mismatch. Run scripts/sync-govulncheck-docs.sh to fix.
