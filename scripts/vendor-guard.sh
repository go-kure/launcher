# vendor-guard.sh — keep the vendored copy of go-kure/.github's forbidden-terms
# guard in sync with the check-forbidden-terms action pin in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml.
#
# .github/workflows/ci.yml's docs-build job checks out go-kure/.github a
# second time (to byte-compare the vendored guard against its canonical
# source) at a ref derived, at CI-run time, from the check-forbidden-terms
# action's own `uses:@<sha>` pin (see the "Resolve pinned guard revision"
# step) — the same single pin Renovate's github-actions manager already
# tracks, so there is nothing left for this script to independently extract
# from a second `ref:` literal.
# This script re-fetches the canonical guard script from go-kure/.github at
# that same pin and re-vendors it, so the vendored copy and the pin move
# together.
#
# Invoked as a Renovate postUpgradeTasks command (renovate.json) whenever the
# go-kure/.github dependency bumps; safe to run by hand too. Idempotent: a
# no-op re-run leaves the vendored file untouched.
#
# The vendored copy is not CI-only: scripts/release.sh runs it as a release
# preflight, and release pushes bypass the merge queue — so it must stay
# fresh even outside a Renovate-driven bump.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/vendor-guard.sh
